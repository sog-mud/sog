These runes are carved into the rock about the pool.  You think you
recognize the rune of vision, and another that has something to do with
projecting power at a distance.

The glyphs are drawn upon the stone with what appears to be blood.
You do not recognize any of them, and it would probably be a good idea not to

The sconces are black and shaped liked two hands, cradling the torches
between their pointed nails.

torches~
The torches are made of a black wood, and as you draw nearer, you find
that they do not emit any heat.  Indeed, they seem to be radiating cold.  The
flames are an icy blue, that makes you think twice about getting too close to
them.
~
E
pool~
As you lean forward and look in the pool, you see nothing but the dark
murky water.  Gradually though, an image forms before you.  You recognize the
person the image shows.  It is the Avatar!  Apparently this is a pool that
Ciquala uses to scry upon her enemies. The image is so clear, you almost
believe you could step into the pool, and appear in Lord British's castle.

The Room of the Automatons~
You gasp as you realize that these pasty faced people do not seem to
have a will of their own.  No doubt the work of the Lich.  If these
monstrosities are allowed to escape into the world, they will cause no end
of problems for Midgaard.

Torture Chamber~
This room is fitted with many instruments and tools designed to cause
pain and fear in anyone who enters.  However, you don't pay as much attention
to the racks and iron maidens as you would if were not for the lich in the
room.

Entrance to Ciquala's Throne Room~
This does not look like any of the other rooms you have been in up till
now.  The ceiling rises a full 40 feet in the air above you.  The walls are
covered with murals proclaiming the might and majesty of Ciquala.  She does
not look old and decayed as you would have pictured her.  Instead, she looks
rather regal and stately, but undoubtedly evil.

Ciquala's Throne Room~
This room is clothed in darkness, and a chill eminates from the foul
monarch of the undead.  A large tapestry hangs behind her throne.  The
ceiling rises above you, hidden in the darkness beyond the range your
light can penetrate.  A feeling of hopelessness and insignificance overwhelms
you as you face the Lich, Ciquala!

Treasure Chamber of Ciquala~
This room contains enough wealth to fund an army, perhaps a small
kingdom.  Racks or weapons, and spellbooks, and potions, not to mention large
piles of coins that cover the floor.  A large paving stone in this room seems
slightly disturbed.

The hidden crypt of Ciquala~
This room contains several crypts where the lichs and vampires rest.
Unfortunately, they all seem to be out of their crypts right now.
