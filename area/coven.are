'When I was an able boy of 18, I worked for my dad in the mine. One day 
I struck out in a new direction, and broke through to this green meadow 
here. I followed the meadow to this temple and found an aged warrior 
here garbed as I am now. He gave me this sickle and robe and froze me 
to this spot. He told me that my task was to wait for the day when a 
hero would step forth from the mine, and if that hero should prove 
worthy, you may find release. He said the exit would be hidden from all 
but the chosen ones. You have come through. Show me you are worthy 
hero, and best me in combat. The forces of evil rise again, and the 
land sings out for a champion. Can you not hear her singing through the 
temple? Strike now and prove yourself worthy. If you win seek knowledge 
in the runes of the sickle and save the cross for dire need. May god be 
with you.'

Before the Forest Murkmire~
Ahead of you lies the dark forest Murkmire. You have heard of it 
before, back when you were but a small child. Your grandmother used to 
tell you tales of the Murkmire to get you to behave. 'If you don't be 
quiet, a ravening beast will smell you out and carry you off to the 
Murkmire!' she would warn you. Now after many years of battle, you have 
hardened and honed your skills to admirable levels. Are you ready to 
face your own inner demons and enter? As you gaze at the road leading 
into the dark woods, you notice a small plaque nailed to a tree.

black raven squawks at you, almost as if it were laughing at you. You 
wing a rock at the bird, and it flies off.

You stand on hard, dry ground in the looming darkness of the Murkmire. 
Around you are old rotted stumps and an impenetrable wall of 
underbrush. You feel hemmed in and pressed by the towering, looming 
hardwoods. The smell of rotting flesh leads you towards the carcass of 
a dead animal wedged in the crook of a tree. Again, tales of the 
ravening beast well up in your mind.

At an Ancient Clearing in Forest Murkmire~
You have wandered into an ancient clearing in the forest. Here, the 
birds have ceased their chatter, and here, the heat lies again in a 
heavy humid embrace. The forest canopy has grown over the clearing, 
blocking out the sky above. The underbrush surrounds you, closing off 
all avenues of escape. There is a smell of death in the air, and you 
feel eyes on the back of your neck.

On a Logging Trail in the Forest Murkmire~
You are mired in mud on an old unused logging trail. You take some 
comfort in the fact that others before you were also so mired, as 
evidenced by the deep tracks in the mud. The towering trees have 
swallowed the sky, and a thick underbrush presses you in, confining you 
to the trail. Above you, high in a tree, a black raven cackles at you 
in the language of its kind. You wing a rock at it and miss. The raven 
continues to laugh at you.

Here, amid the towering trees of the Murkmire, man has carved a small

the sight of many bodies lying about the clearing in twisted broken

workers on the table. The noise is deafening, and the mill workers take 
no notice of you. You look over and see a variety of fine work being 
done, mainly furniture items and one craftsman working on a sign.

You stare hypnotically into the dancing flames. Images form in the 
fires. Images of enemies. Dead evil enemies you have killed. Their 
faces twist in horror as their bodies burn, regenerate, and burn again, 
in a never-ending painful cycle. You feel drawn towards them, and start 
to walk toward them, when something wet hits you in the eye. You look 
up and see a white dove pin wheeling higher into the sky, through the 
treetops. Gratefully you wipe the guano from you eye.

The Outer Circle of Coven~
You stand in a circular clearing, bounded by brush on the outside, and 
with trees in the center. The twisted trees of the center grow 
exceptionally high here, and blot out the sky in a black canopy. The 
ground you stand on has a silvery sheen to the dirt, as if some 
precious metal has been sprinkled here. To the center of the clearing a 
bright fire roars, and reaches for the treetops in a hellish blaze.

The Inner Circle of Coven~
You stand in the inner circle of coven, amid the trees. The ground and 
trees here are scorched, from the raging fire in the pit below you, at 
the center of the circle. Across the way you see a warlock toss 
fist-sized something into the pit, and the fire leaps higher, greedily 
consuming the item. There is a heavy aura of evil here which threatens 
and beckons to you.

Into the Fire~
You have plunged into the raging flames. You feel your equipment and 
skin start to sear, but just as you have given up hope, a warm feeling 
fills your body and mind, and eases your pain. In you head you hear 
'good luck my champion, may you fare well in your bout with the 
creature from hell. Be sure to recover the amulet, as it will unlock 
the flame barrier and allow you to return to the real world. Remember 
always to stay on the path of righteousness.' And with that, the voice 
and warmth vanish.

52 coven~
This area has the following basic plot. Some townsmen fall in with a
witch coven, which is lead by a hell creature. The coven raids the 
lumber operation and takes blood sacrifice for their devil. Players 
should wander into town and piece together this part of the adventure 
by looking at the various mobs. In town they will find a shovel, which 
will allow them into an old mine which leads to the temple guardian. 
There is some subtlety here- for instance, if they count corpses in the 
glade, they will count 11 bodies, but both through mobs and on the new 
sign in the mill, the villagers are missing only 10 people, so one of 
the bodies is not from Dunkeldorf. If they examine bodies, on one they 
will find branded a pentagram, which shows that one was a witch 
impostor. So If the players are smart, they can piece together that the 
witches impersonated lumberjacks and sabotaged them (and there might be 
one right now in Dunkeldorf- there is in the inn). The guardian is a 
prophecy threshold, if the heroes pass they can gain a key (the gold 
sickle) which will cut through the magic hedge surrounding the coven. 
Once in the coven, they discover the horrible truth of the witchcraft 
practice of blood sacrifice. If they are playing good guys, they should 
slay all of the witches. From there they can move on to the fire, which 
is pick proof from inside, and the devil carries the key. IF they kill 
the devil, they escape with otherworldly treasure.
