The Battle Field~
  Most probably you fled here, if you are not a cabal member of INVADERS.
Thus the darkness of the room horrifies you. While waiting the time
that your adrenalin will calm down, you want to rest. But you know that
this place is NOT the safe place to rest. Because it is Battle Field of
INVADERS!
