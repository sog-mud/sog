Fifth Level~
  The fifth level of the tower hums with whole magical power of the

transported from different lands. Probably they have been used to reached
the secret of the magical worlds; the stones sing and glow magically.
Before you is an altar shaped like a huge spider. Carved from diamond,
it gives off a soft purple radiance.
