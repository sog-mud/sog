Entrance Street~
As you enter from the sea, you suddenly are aware of a type of
stability and balance that is not typical of being underwater.
Standing and walking is now almost like being in the open air, thanks
to the power of the Gem of Salvation.
    Looking ahead you can see the Temple of Anthar just a bit further
to the north.  The city looks huge from here, even though you know
that a great portion of the northern section of the city is now in
ruins, with the waning power of the Gem.  Antharians are walking
everywhere, a serious people.  They do not seem to be totally
heartless, just aware of what they have to do to survive.  "Work
before play" is the motto that Antharians live by.
    Looking directly up..you can see a clear shot right to the
surface..you're amazed at how easy it is to notice the sun at this
depth.  More Antharian magic, you think.

Entrance Street~
As you get closer to the Temple of Anthar, the power of the gem
becomes more and more resonate.  The Temple of Anthar is just a bit
further to the north, and from here you can see the big Gem of
Salvation mounted on top of it.  The Gem looks, from here, to be a
huge red stone mounted in a golden tripod.  There is a faint, but
visible ray of light that emits from the gem, blanketing the city in a
protective aura.  The sheer power that emits from the gem is awesome
in iteslf, the wizards of ancient Antharia must have been akin to
gods.
    The street continues north from here to the Temple, or south back
to the Sea.

You are standing just south of the grand temple of Anthar.  This seems
to be the center of life in the city of Antharia -- Antharians are
passing by here on a regular basis.  Also, you can almost hear the
humming power radiating from the Gem of Salvation mounted upon the
Temple.  
    From here you can walk around the temple to the east or west...or
you can return to the Sea by going south.  There is also a Magical
sign posted here, put up by the councils of Antharia after the initial
contact with Anon.

    At this point in time, it is illegal for any non-Antharian to
enter the Temple of Antharia.  As we speak, democratic relations with
the other races are making progress to allow this policy to be
removed.  Please bear with us and do not attempt to enter the most
holy temple.

Main Road of Antharia~
You are walking around the grand Temple of Anthar towards the
east.  The road here is very well kept, and protected day and night by
the guards of Antharia.  Antharians flash you a quick smile as they
pass, busy in their work.  Looking around there are many private
residents visible, their houses hugging the road just like any other
city of this size.  Although old, they are well kept and in good
condition.

This road circles around the Grand Temple of Anthar.  Just
standing here, you feel the magnitude of just how much was put into
its building.  You can only imagine at the amount of labor force it
took to build something of this magnitude.  Now, with the Gem of
Salvation mounted on the top of the temple, it is even more
impressive.  The temple seems to be a focus of tremendous power, you
feel that if you could just get inside, you could aquire some of that
power.  
    The road continues to the north and south.

Temple Circle~
Taking a closer look at the temple from this angle, you can tell
that it is made of many different levels. It seems to be built almost as
a pyramid:  large at the base, and getting smaller as it goes up.  The
connections between the levels seems to be implicable, almost perfect
in their accuracy.  You wonder, did the wizards help in this
accomplishment, or were the Antharian masons of that time incredibly
good?  Maybe the secret lies within the temple....

Temple Circle at Kaer's Bridge~
You are standing just north of the Temple of Anthar, and just
south of Kaer's Bridge.  According to Antharian history, Kaer was a
king just prior to the catastrophy that forced Antharia underwater.
Wanting to be remembered for all time, he had this bridge built in his
name.  It is a bridge made of the same material as the Temple --
something that we have no knowledge of today.  However, you can feel
the material, and it feels smooth and glossy..almost like ivory.  You
assume that this bridge once spanned a river or something of that
nature; however, now this bridge spannes a channel filled with the
same water that you are now breathing.

Temple Circle~
Taking a closer look at the the temple from this angle, you can
tell that it is made of many different levels.  Seems to be built
almost as a pyramid:  large at the base, and getting smaller as it
goes up.  The connections between the levels seems to be implicable,
almost perfect in its accuracy.  You wonder, did the wizards help in
this accomplishment, or were the Antharian masons of that time
incredibly good?  Maybe the secret lies within the temple...

Temple Circle~
This road circles around the grand Temple of Anthar.  Just
standing here, you feel the magnitude of just how much was put into
its building.  You can only imagine at the amount of labor it took to
build something of this magnitude.  Now, with the Gem of Salvation
mounted on the top of the temple, it is even more impressive.  The
temple seems to be a focus of tremendous power, you fell that if you
could just get inside, you could aquire some of that power.

You are walking around the grand Temple of Anthar towards the
east.  The road here is very well kept, and protected day and night by
the guards of Antharia.  Antharians flash you a quick smile as they
pass, busy in their work.  Looking around, there are many private
residents visible, their houses hugging the road just like any other
city of this size.  Although old, they are well kept and in good
condition.

In this particular section of street there are children playing
games.  Running and playing, they make you remember your childhood.
Just like all children, these children have that internal need to
play IN the street -- instead of in the park or other, more sensible
places.  
     Instead of running in fright, these children seem to be intrigued
by your presence.  Looking at you in curiosity, they almost look as
though they might talk to you.

There is a heavy amount of traffic, as people go to and from the
Temple of Anthar via the bridge, and also this street is a shortcut
across town.
     Just north of here is a dignified building of Ertuvia the
Weaponsmith.  Instead of the clanging of metal that is usually
associated with weaponsmiths, there is only the sound of talking
coming from the building.

As with most bridges built in the past, the bridge rises in the
center and comes down on both ends.  From here it is a little easier
to see parts of the city.  Two things stand out more than the rest
though: the Temple of Anthar to the south, and a larger, more
spectacular building to the far north.  You assume that this northern
building is part of the ruins of grand Antharia.
    This bridge is used heavily, as it connects the Temple Circle to
Center street.

Main Road of Antharia~
Walking along this road is never boring.  Even though it is very
symetrical in form, the houses and people that you pass never leave
you with nothing to study.  Just the fact that this city could have
survived at all under these conditions is amazing in itself, but for
their artwork and architecture to survive is a miracle.
     Antharians are very good at making simple houses look like
mansions.  After the house is built (all of which are quite old now),
the Antharian family spends the rest of their life adding carvings and
paintings to their individual houses.  As generations pass, this
artwork gets more and more impressive.  Antharians are very proud of
their heritage.

Antharia.  Antharians now call what Antharia was in the past, "grand
Antharia", and they tell the story of grand Antharia not unlike
gospel.  The Antharians are very proud of their heritage and grand
Antharia is a major part of that heritage.  Right now, there is a kind
of magic wall between this section of the city, and the older ruined
section.  Representatives from the other races and the city of
Anon are working to gain permission to explore this section of
Antharia.  
    At this point in time, on Zaertses is allowed to explore these
ruins.  He is known to tell stories sometimes; however, he is usually
very quiet about the things that he has seen.  What wanders await us
in the ruins of grand Antharia?

You are standing at the gate of the zoo of Antharia.  Looking
through the gate, you get a glimpse of known and unknown animals
contained therein.  According to the Antharians, the zoo was built
before the catastophy -- as hard as that might be to believe.  It is
said that the Council of Clerics at that time insisted that the zoo be
one of the protected areas.  They wished to preserve the endangered and
unusual animals that they had aquired through the generations.  Now,
this is the most extensive and important zoo in the world, as it
contains animals that is found nowhere else.
    As with many of aspects of the Antharian culture, this zoo is not
currently opened to non-Antharians.  Hopefully, the other races can
convince the Antharians to allow other races to explore and
investigate the zoo.

the discovery that will bring Antharia back to the splendor that it

    The building itself seems to radiate with magical power, even

Forgotten Room~
This room is full of cobwebs and dust..as no one has been here in
such a long time.   You have obviously stumbled upon a part of
Antharian history, as the room still looks like it did 2000 yrs ago.

#HELPS
0 ANTHARIA~
This is taken from the latest edition of the Barren Realms High
School History textbook..

	The kingdom of Antharia, one the new discoveries of the modern
world, has a very intestesting history.  Being one of the oldest races
of beings in existence, they have much knowledge that we do not, and
much knowledge that they no longer posess.  We can see this more
clearly by studing a bit of the history of the capital city, Antharia. 
	About a thousand years ago, Antharia was a very productive and
thriving kingdom, so old that many problems that face most kingdoms
had been solved.  The Realm was ruled by what they called a
constitutional monarchy.  They had a king, who worked as a figurehead
and public leader.  However, the true working laws and policies were
dictated by a two councils:  The High council of Wizards, and the Holy
Order of Priests.  These two groups worked very well together, and
made Antharia one of the best places to live. It was these councils
who made the discovery that would change the lives of every Antharian.
	It was discovered that there was going to be a major upheaval
of the world's outer crust, which would make the whole country of
Antharia, which was actually a big island, in essense, sink into the ocean. 
Fearing for the lives of their citizens, the councils worked quickly
to come up with a solution to the disaster.  
	After many months of searching, it was decided that there was
only solution:  the wizards would have to combine their power to
create a "Gem of Salvation".  This gem would, in essense, keep the
whole city of Antharia with air, even underwater -- a dome, if you
will.  However, this also forced the government to make the decisions
of who would be able to live and who would die...the city could only
hold so many people.  
	
	The Antharians are very hesistant to talk about this time in
their history.  Understandbly, it was very hard to make those
decisions; therefore, much of the next few decades are lost to us.
However, there was to be an even more dramatic change in the lives of
the Antharians.

	As the Antharians were getting used to living in an underwater
city, the council of wizards made another discovery which almost cost
us the culture of Antharia forever.  The gem was working, but getting
weaker with every day.  Not anticipating this, the wizards again
started looking for solutions to this problem.  With the help of the
priests of Anthar the wizards came up with the solution that created
the Antharian people that we know today.
	They had decided that the only way of saving their people was
to transform themselves into Creatures that could breathe water.
However, this process took the powers of all the wizards of Antharia,
and that meant that none of the wizards could be transformed.  Knowing
that this was the only hope for their people, the wizards made this
sacrifice.  The Day of Transformation is still celebrated as a holiday
to this day -- and the wizards who gave up their lives are revered in
loving memory.

	We are lucky that these wizards took time to teach their
students the way to take care of the Gem.  It was altered to simply
provide stable gravity and protection from preditors and falling
debris.  The gem is still functioning to this day.
