A massive gold dragon rests idly as it waits patiently for battle.~
This dragon has come to aid in the coming battle against Legion. It's time
is nearing and it is weaker than it's size would indicate, but it wishes to
do one last great thing for the cause of good before it passes on.

This dragon is awaiting the battle with Arkham's forces and it looking forward
to a nice tasty meal of human flesh. Afterwards it will join the ranks of the
undead by sacrificing it's mortal flesh to become a powerful dracolich. It
wears an unholy amulet that will preserve it's essence during the transition,
and is looking forward to the next stage of it's existence.

an ancient black dragon~
A massive black silhoutte of a dragon stands out against the dark sky.~
The power of Legion has seduced this ancient wyrm with the one thing it cannot
accomplish itself..the becoming of a dracolich. It wears an amulet that will
preserve it's essence during the weeks of change, at the end of which it will
be raised as an undead dragon of immense power. For now it serves as help to
Legion in the oncoming battles, a small favour for the immortality it will
obtain once raised in lich form.

makes it very poor for defending oneself with, although by virtue of it's

Inside the blasted gates~
You are in the ruins of what was once either a small town or large
fortress. Around you thick black smoke rises up from burnt buildings and
bodies lie scattered beneath the rocks. The street way you are on
continues north through the ruins, or you can go south back towards the
muddy grounds of the swamp island.

On a burnt and blasted street~
This street of the Legion fortress is covered in rubble from the recent
attack by magic and physical might. The Arkham army has dealt a serious
blow to the powers of Legion here, but something is not quite right. Far
north at the end of the rubbled streets you can make out a large black
tower that somehow seems almost unaffected by the battle that has reduced
the rest of the region to ruins.

On a devestated street~
The street here is totally destroyed. Buildings on either side have been
reduced to mere rubble and the ground itself appears to have cracked open
by some kind of tremendous force. Arkham's forces could not have created
such destruction and you now notice that most of the bodies in the rubble
wear the armor of Arkham guards. The street continues north and south.

On a ruined street~
The street is blocked by rubble and debri from the previous battles. The
side streets leading from this one are all collapsed and filled with
impassable ruins. It is almost impossible to believe that Arkham's forces
could have caused such destruction, and even stranger is the fact that
almost all the corpses are of Arkham forces. To the north a large black
tower stands tall above the ruins, unmarked by the battles and ominously
quiet.

on the ground and floors to indicate where the darkness ends and the stone
walls begin. In the south wall is the faint outline of a grey door spattered
in rust coloured blood. The corridor heads east.

On the blood soaked roof of a black turret~
This turret's roof is covered in a thick layer of sticky, cold blood. The
howling winds over arkham's swamp blasts at you mercilessly and you find it
hard to balance on the slick surface. The turret roof continues north, east
and south.

On a wooden walkway over the swamp~
You are on a narrow and treacherous walkway that barely rises above the swamp
muck all around you. Dirty thick waters lap at your feet as you walk along it
and the stench of foul odours cling to everything in sight. Something plops in
the muddy bogs and somewhere else a loud squelch can be heard from another
local beast. The walkway continues east and west.

You are at a bend on the wooden plank walkway that leads over the watery part
of the swamp. To the north you can make out an island within the swamp and a
large, dark structure looming over it all further inland. The sounds of loud
voices and people in some kind of working frenzy can be heard. The walkway
leads west, or north to where it ends at the edge of the island.

small wooden tower rising over the island. The island continues north and

heads. Further north on the island you can make out a large dark structure of
some kind that looms ominously over the island. East and west the island
continues.

You are at the entrance to what appeared to be a large fortress of town of
some kind. Now the gates of obsidian are blasted wide open by some powerful
magic and smoke rises lazily above the burning rubble. The blackened walls
head east and west around the ruins, while to the north a stone pathway heads
into the ruins and towards a towering structure at it's centre. South of here
lie the swampy grounds of the Arkham swamps.
