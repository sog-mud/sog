the ancient dracolich~
The massive skeleton of an ancient dragon rises in fury!~
This massive dracolich was once one of the greatest red dragons ever to
live.  In death the greater lords of darkness gathered it's form and used
the most unholy of magics to animate the corpse into a new phase of
existence.  The mortal flesh was shed and only the skeletal form was
presevered.  It's mind was then gathered from the shadows and reinstituted
into the new form, allowing It to once again walk the mortal planes as a
major free-willed undead.  Now it serves as It's lord's main form of
transport, enjoying the privilages it gets from such a duty.

An snowbound mountainside~
You find yourself trudging knee-deep in snow as you navigate the 
freezing mountainside. All around you is white snow and shattered ice. 
In the distance you hear something's roar echo through the mountain.

The lair of the white dragon~
You stand in a large iced-over clearing of rocks.  Snow lies thickly over
everything, covering up most, but not all, of the bones that lie scattered
around.  Something huge lives here, something huge and very cold.

At the end of a pier over the black lake~
You stand at the end of the pier but mist hangs heavily over the lake
blocking most of the view.  It is from here that Charon the boatkeeper takes
some the lost souls to hell and you had best not interfere with any of the
ghostly avatars he sends to conduct his work here.

On an unused road in a misty valley~
You walk along a dirty old road that looks as if it hasn't been used for 
a long, long time. Mist hangs heavily in the air blocking out much of 
the light and making it seem like perpetual night covers the valley.
The roadway leads east and west.

At a gate in the misty road~
You walk along a dirty old road that looks as if it hasn't been used for
a long, long time.  Mist hangs heavily in the air blocking out much of the
light and making it seem like perpetual night covers the valley.  Finally
you stumble into a broken, rusty gate that hangs loosely in the wind.  On
the other side the mist hangs even more heavily and all you can see is a
dark open area with large moving shapes within it.  The road itself leads
back east while the clearing opens out to the west.

Lost in a misty field~
These fields span an incredible area. They must've been once used for 
the town crops and animals, but now they are blighted and rocky. The 
mist embraces you with a cold chill as if trying to absorb you into the 
eternal devestation of the land. All around you shapes move decadently 
in the shadows.

A small underground pool~
You stumble out into a broad open cavern.  Some of your light shines on a
pool of water that lies here stagnant and uninviting.  On closer inspection
you realise that the water isn't actually water but thinned out blood that's
seeped from the ceiling and walls to form a sticky wet puddle.

A pitch-black tunnel~
Shadows flicker about you in the haze of your light and receeding echoes 
haunt your steps. The darkness encloses you in a cold embrace and only 
the sounds of your own breathing are here to keep you company...or is 
that a scraping sound you hear in the distance...
The tunnel ends here and the only way out is back east.

You stand at the end of a rocky pathway through high shadowy mountains. 
A dark cave leads into the ground here, but light doesn't seem to penetrate
more than a few metres.  From the east a howl of great anguish and loss
rides in on the chill winds.  The path leads east into the mountain range or
you can go down into the cave.

A dark rocky pathway~
The path through the mountains is subdued and darkened.  On the ground
small pools of dark liquid have accumulated and congealed.  At a second
glance you realise it is blood and that the drops are quite recent; it
almost seems as if someone has been dragged through here.  A soft moaning
sound comes from the south while the passage continues east to even darker
regions or west towards a large mountain.

Before the bone gates~
The pathway through the mountains ends here at a huge set of gates made
of bone.  A pair of huge arching spines constitute the frame of the gate
while blackened and charred plates of over-lapping demon bone cascade down
to fill in the gate's body.  It is beyond comprehension what could sort of
creature could have had such bones.  The path leads north into the
mountains, while trough the gateway you can hear faint sounds of demonic
laughter....

and someone has been killing them, someone very powerful.

Antechamber to the shadowlord's room~
This darkened room reminds you of a crypt.  Nothing stirs, not even the
wind, and even cries of agony and despair seem muted and far off.  Statues
of the many of the greater demons and devils of the Abyss' 666 layers have
been erected here: Orcus, Demogorgon, Pazuzus, Asmodeus, Bael, Molok and
others stare back at you with such intensity you feel yourself cringing.  A
landing lies south and to the east a door blocks the way but not the
prescence of something unspeakable.
