@eng The Dancing Daemon Inn@rus Гостиница Танцующий Демон.~
@eng A huge circling wet-bar takes up most of the east end of the Daemon. An
old mage reclines against the mirror behind the bar absentmindedly pouring
several drinks at once with his refined telekinesis. The Lokettes, a local
band, are playing their usual gig on the stage. The large booths along the
wall are filled with people drinking and having a grand time. You feel like
partying here.
The only obvious exit is to the north.
@rus Огромный вращающийся бар (bar) со спиртными напитками занимает большую
часть восточной стороны Демона.  Перед зеркалом, позади бара, поллулежит
старый маг, рассеяно, одновременно наливая несколько спиртных напитков при
помощи чистого телекинеза.  Локетес, местная группа, играет на сцене их
народный танец.  Большие кабины вдоль стены заполнены пьющими и отдыхающими
людьми.  Вы чуствуете себя здесь, как на вечеринке.  Единственный очевидный
выход ведет на север (north).

@eng The Southeastern Market Square@rus Юго-восточная часть рынка~
@eng In this corner of the market some of the largest warriors in the land
tower over you. It's easy to understand why they hangout here once you
notice the weapon shop and the armory close by. Perhaps you might stop
in and take a look at the wares these shops have to offer.
@rus В этом углу рынка над вами возвышаются несколько величайших воинов на
земле.  Вы понимаете почему они собрались здесь, как только замечаете рядом
оруженую лавку и лавку доспехов.  Возможно вы остановитесь и посмотрите на
товар, который могут предложить вам в этих лавках.

so you have to assume the noise comes from the Butchery. You have to

East Ishtar Drive~
Even in broad daylight, you can hardly see into the back alley that begins
here and heads north. Sounds of loud drunken folk and the occasional
screaming cat emenate from the direction. Luckily you have the choice of
going east or west down the drive as well.

East Ishtar Drive~
Your highly acute sense of smell reports you have reached the entrance
to the fish market. Although renowned for it fresh catches and
wide selection of aquarian delicacies you wonder how much longer you
can endure the smell! The Ishtar River flows alongside to the south
with the drive running alongside it east to west.

East Ishtar Drive~
The sound of squawking gulls and the smell of rotting fish gives you a hint
of your location. The Ishtar River flows south of you, but looks crystal
clear, so it cannot be the source of this putrid smell. Looking north you
notice a small sign hanging over the dump.

Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,
  Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,
  One for the Dark Lord on his Dark Throne
In the Land of Mordor where Shadows lie.
  One ring to rule them all, One ring to find them,
  One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
If I have to explain, you wouldn't understand.

Now here's a room that is easy to understand. A bed, a dresser, and a
rack for weapons and armor are all that occupy it. Some posters adorn
the walls, to add color, proclaiming things such as Live fast, Die Young,
and a homemade one in the corner with a picture of Ice and under it the
inscription, "I LOVE the resurrection spell". The only thing out of
place in this happy-go-lucky room is mounted head of Crimson Death.

@eng Inside the Castle of Brand@rus Внутри замка Бранда~
@eng You have entered the grand hall of the castle. A huge throne dominates a
raised area in the northern part of then room. In front of this stands a
drafting table.
@rus Вы вошли в главный зал замка.  Огромный трон возвышается над всем в
северной части комнаты.  Помотрев на трон вы приходите в экстаз от красоты
трона.  Трон выполнен из костей BattleRagerov покрытых тонкими узорами из
листового золота, шикарные подлокотники вырезанные из цельных изумрудов
выполнены в виде головы лидера клана Battleragerov оскаленного в
предсмертных судоргах.  По стенам зала развешаны тонкие шелковые гобелены
изображающие последние моменты жизи всех известных врагов магии.  Эти
картины в тяжелые времена успакаивают взор хозяина замка.  Пол покрыт
тонкими плитками мрамора с изображением подвигов героев клана Shalafi. 
Посреди комнаты стоит огромный стол из красного дерева вокруг которого
расположены мягкие кресла с изображением эмблемы клана Shalafi.  Довольно
часто здесь собираются друзья владельца замка и обсуждают свои планы.

This is the place where the people of the city dump their trash. Due to
the constant winds blowing down the moutains the smell is usually blown
outside the walls and over the desert.

You stand in the top of an old stone tower. Along the walls hundreds of
potions, scroll, and wands lie in disarray. The man you see before you
sits hunched over a small wooden table with two beakers of bubbling
liquid in front of him. He looks up as you enter and smiles broadly.

Nowhere have you seen such an obscene display of wealth than in this
corridor. The shag carpeting under your feet makes it seem as if you are
walking on a cloud. Platinum candelabras hang delicately from the ceiling
casting light on the ancient tapestries adorning the walls. The crick
in your neck tells you it's time to stop staring. To the west the
numerous halls of the palace begin and the gate lies to the east.

Saska's Library~
Fine, golden dust swirls and then settles as you enter Saska's
library. Leatherbound volumes of Shakespeare rest next to paperbacks by
Tom Robbins, and Toni Morrison's _Sula_ is open on the striking table: an
antique birdbath of polished blond wood, with glass set over the waterwell
to give the appearance of a perfectly still pool.  Trinkets, lightly
lifted from the mantles of the wealthy whose chimneys she cleaned, line
the windowsills and create space between the different sections of books.
A crystal oil lamp seems to float on the table; a piece of paper on the
wall, written in Saska's own lingering script, reads: "For what is your friend
that you would seek him with hours to kill?  Seek him always with hours to
live.  --Kahlil Gibran."
    A cat purrs somewhere, though you cannot see the source, and you feel
yourself tugged into the softened space. Have a seat in one of the enormous
papasan chairs, and choose a title that strikes you.

too steep for you to see very far.

The waters of the river crash down upon a rock and split into

course and the new river heads off to the east. To the west you notice
a flat area in the sheer rock where it would be possible to shore your
craft. The River of lost souls also continues to the north.

The people of New Thalos take great pride in the services their
city may provide. One of these services is the construction crews
that go to great lengths to keep all the roads in order. Although
the taxes in New Thalos are higher than other cities in the realm
most of the money is used for the good of the people.
