Alice~
Alice raises her eyebrows and says "Curiouser and curiouser!"
~
In her amazement she has completely forgotten proper English. As if the
inrecdible sights of Wonderland weren't enough, now she has encountered you,
a strange being clad in dozens of different types of armor with no regard for
fashion. Small wonder she is both amazed and afraid of you!

white rabbit~
a white rabbit~
A smartly dressed white rabbit scurries by, muttering to himself.
~
"I'm late! I'm late!" he seems to be saying, which is impossible as rabbits
don't talk. Or do they? He was certainly very well dressed for a rabbit, or
for anyone for that matter. Perhaps you'd fancy acquiring some of his
accoutrements? After all, how hard could he be to slay?

in the air.

executioner~
the executioner~
The executioner is wandering about muttering about disembodied heads.
~
This fellow is perhaps at the same time both the busiest and the least-busy
of the Queen's staff. For while he is constantly being ordered to decapitate
hundreds of people, he never actually carries out the task. He is currently
attempting to figure out a way to decapitate the head of the Cheshire Cat
from... nothing. Such are the weird ways of Wonderland.

the Mock Turtle~
The Mock Turtle is here weeping constantly.

The Mock Turtle is the thing Mock Turtle soup is made from. He is attempting
to tell you his tale, but he is weeping so much you doubt he'll ever get a
word out. The Turtle has the head of a pig, the shell of a turtle and the
legs and tail of a cow. How peculiar!

A Grassy Field~
You are standing in a rather pleasant green field, by the banks of a softly
flowing brook. To the east, you can see a small hedge row, beneath which you
think you can make out a rabbit hole. Suddenly, a rabbit dashes past,
muttering something about being late, and disappears down the hole! Oddly
enough, it has a pocket watch, and you have never seen a rabbit with a 
watch. You are inspired to investigate!

The Rabbit Hole~
You are falling down a rabbit hole, unlike any you have ever seen in your
life! The walls are lined with shelves filled with jars of many different
substances. And though you are falling without restraint, you do not feel
that it will cause you any injury upon impact.

The Bottom of the Hole~
After falling for what seemed like at once forever and hardly any time at
all, you reach the bottom, landing with a soft thump. To the east stretches
a long corridor lined with lamps and locked doors. You see the rabbit
disappear around a corner and leap up to give chase, though you don't know
why.

A Long Hallway~
You try the handles of several of the doors, but they are all locked and
look too strong to pick or bash down. The rabbit's tail can be seen
disappearing around a corner just up ahead.

drop something on the way. You hear what sounds like water lapping against

0 'AREA THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS'~
This area was written on a DOS Text Editor by Yaegar, based on the two best-
known works of the brilliant and eccentric Lewis Carroll. It is not a literal
interpretation- some aspects cannot be reproduced identically in Muds- but it
attempts to faithfully recreate the atmosphere as closely as possible, with
many people and places from several of Carroll's works included.

NOTE- a LOT of the flavor and fun of this area will be lost if the triggers
are not present or functioning properly, so if you are going to use this
area on any other mud than AnonyMud! i would suggest you write appropriate
mob_progs or endeavour to modernize your mud with the truly brilliant
trigger code by the coders at AnonyMud!

Enjoy!

Yaegar, October 1996.
