    To whom it may concern,

        Merc Industries has installed a new no-rent save and quit
        system.  Apparently one can now save and quit at any time
        from anywhere inside a town or out.  My services here are

I am not sure about all information in this book, because the adventurer
who told me the story was not...........................................
Firstly you will need a dress for the keeper. You may find a suitable
dress in the general store in New Thalos area. Say to shopkeeper keeper
( say keeper) and he will help you. Now you need a beautiful rug for the
Fireflash who has the key of kassandra. Fireflash interests only with special
rug which has been sold by grocer in Valley of Titans area. Now, you
should find the keeper who will unlocks the gate to you against the
dress. I don't know the exact place of the keeper and Fireflash,
but I heard that they are in an area which includes many pixies and
dragons. As you give the dress to keeper he will helps you. And now you
should give rug to Fireflash. Now you have a key find the Paladin who is
responsible for the stone kassandra. Adventured said me that you may find
that paladin in the south and up of the Midgaard. 
	Usage of the kassandra is very easy, as you are holding it say :
"  kassandra, matandra, or sebat."
eg, say kassandra
    say sebat

Kate's Diner~
  The smells of baking bread and simmering stew lead you dancing through
the doorway of the diner.  No greasy spoons to be seen here-- the
booth walls are covered in casual paisleys; the chairs are carved wood,
rescued from garage sales.  Most tables have chess or backgammon boards
carved and painted on their fingertip-smooth tops.  The refrain of some
musical or other from the 1930's blends with the dusty golden light and the
wonderful smells to put you completely at ease.  A huge picture window
looks out over the Midgaard River, and a doorway leads north onto the dock
and the South Bank river landing, while the main entrance to the south
returns you to Austral Square.
On most days you will find Kate here, testing a batch of stew or brewing
a special pot of cinnamon coffee, eerily just in time for your arrival
Pull up a chair, perhaps play a game, and take time out to talk.

slightly less clutter than the rest of the shop is in front of you.  A scroll 
case full of scrolls is behind the desk.  A bookcase is to the right of you,

A Money Changer's Room~
A few strategically placed lanterns keep this place well-lit in the 
absence of any windows.  The room is surprisingly well appointed with  
tapestries hanging on the walls.  You'd wager your life the moneylender's
guards are behind them, as there are none here.  The moneylender himself
works from behind a large desk, no doubt holding a fortune in gold and silver.
A smallish sign hangs on the wall, lettered in common.

Grebe's Tavern~
Dive.  That's all you can say about this place; its a
dive.  You step carefully over the dead and/or drunk sailors
on the floor toward the center of the room.  There's no
decorations on the wall; they've all been ripped down in anger
or for use as weapons at one time or another.  Looking around,
you search vainly for a clean table to sit at, and then give up.

The busy pub is filled with patrons.  People are laughing and singing.
A minstrel plays his lute in another part of the pub, and a few people
are even dancing.  Andy, the pubs owner, wanders around and checks to see
that the needs of his customers are met.  The bar is to your south.  East

A Room in the Pub~
This part of the pub is filled with dancing and singing.  A wandering
minstrel is on a chair in a corner with his lute.  A busty red headed
woman is standing near him and singing a tale of comedic heroism. Drunk
men sit laughing at their tables and busy bar maids weave through the
crowd with full mugs and horns of ale and mead.  Another part of the pub
is located to your west. The bar is to the south.  A set of steps occupy
in a corner of the room.  They lead up to the inn section of this
prosperous establishment.

strong but friendly-looking bartender stands next to the cask polishing
glasses.  A couple of the bar maids stand in a corner and throw the most

The Inn~
You are standing upstairs from Andy's Pub at Andy's Inn.  A few chairs
and a couple of end tables give the room a `homey' atmosphere.  A large
stone fireplace burns brightly against one wall and warms the room.  A
large oak desk is nestled in one corner of the room.  A small man with
wire-framed glasses sits behind the desk working dilligently on his books.
He looks up as you enter the room.  He looks at you quizzically.  He is
probably waiting for you to ask him for a room.
