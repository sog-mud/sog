they are continuously hungry.  This is not a good place to be.  Your gaze

The Secret Room~
When you finally make it to this room, you are incredibly exhausted.  
You sit down to rest on an old trunk.  As you sit, you brush aside some dust 
on the trunk.  The shine from your light off the golden chest is blinding.  As 
you try to open it, you realize in disappointment that it is locked.  
However 
if you look around, you may find something hidden that will open it.
