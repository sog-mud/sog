Base of the Plant~
You are at the base of a giant plant with leaves of seven points. 
You notice a sweet smell in the air, and begin to feel lightheaded 
as you inhale this tasty air. As you look up you see buds of orange, 
red, blue, green, and purple. The beautiful colors and the way you 
are feeling invite you to explore further.
