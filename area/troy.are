achilles~
Achilles~
Achilles sits here, sulking.
~
Achilles is sulking in his tent due to a slight from Agamemnon. This is
unfortunate for the Achaeans, as he is their most powerful warrior. He is
favored of the gods, and possessed of supernatural defenses as he was
dipped in the Styx while a babe. He was given a choice long ago to live a
long but uneventful life, or a short but action-filled life, and he chose
the latter.

flight. If they could fly the war would have ended years ago. You chuckle

him, and he is punishing the Mycenaean ruler by refusing to take to the

warrior.

The Battlefield~
You are walking across the battlefield before the walls of Troy, where the
besieging army of the Achaeans, led by Agamemnon, have sat encamped for
years, the monotony only broken by the occasional battle. Tents lay
everywhere, housing the many soldiers that currently call this place home.

Idoemeneus' Tent~
This is the tent of Idomeneus, King of the Cretans (NOT Cretins ;P). He is
Agamemnon's best and most trusted captain, and as such is highly respected
by the Achaeans.

Menestheus' Tent~
Menestheus is a prince from Athens, and leader of the Athenian contingent
sent to the war. He is not a major player so I won't give him a major
room description.

This is the tent of the Argive prince Tlepolemus, son of the legendary
Heracles. He is a mighty warrior and a great ally of the Achaean forces.

The Horse~
This is a broad clearing full of tradesmen and a huge, half-finished wooden
horse. You see scattered about the clearing wooden rabbits, badgers, stoats,
turtles, hawks and echidnas. Evidently a lot of thought went into the final
choice for the lure...
