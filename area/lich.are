This Area, "The Lich's Tower" has been designed by Ryzen for HIGH level
characters.  Recomended levels for this area are 45-75, anyone under that, I
suggest strongly that you avoid this area as there are several aggresive
mobs.  However, as this area is the only way to get to a few others, the
mobs do NOT detect invis, so as long as you are invis you should be able to
get where you want to go, Alive.  ===> RYZEN <===

Before the Tower~
You stand before a grand, black tower.  The terror rising up inside of
your soul is nearly overwhelming as you stare at its obsidian form.  The
tower walls project an aura of death and evil making you feel quite
insignificant.  To the north a large mountain has sprouted from the ground
to block all hopes of passage.  You may go back east to the path, or
continue west under an archway.  (LOOK CROSS!!!)

Beneath the Archway~
The walls of this room disappear above you, completing an arch somewhere
in the darkness over your head.  Thorn covered vines hang from the walls in
thick entanglements; you find yourself getting scratched in the most
annoying of places.  From the west comes the faint light of torches, and
from the north you hear what can only be described as an unholy growl.

The Dracolich's Lair~
You find yourself in awe of the treasure and artifacts amassed in this
room.  One object of truly unusual looks catches your eye.  It appears to be
a set of gigantic riding equipment, including a large saddle.  Just as you
are wondering what could possibly fill that saddle, you notice the tremendous
form of a dracolich towering above you.  The only exit is south, under the
archway.

of humans and demi-humans being slaughtered by horrible undead hoards. 
Torches hang on the walls surrounded by old shields and weapons, artifacts
from battles long past.  Two exits lead from the room, one south and one
west.  From where you stand it is impossible to see what type of rooms lie
beyond.

realms of hell is for them to make it through the maze of caverns below you.
