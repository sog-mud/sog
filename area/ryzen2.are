The End of the Cavern~
The natural rock formations come to an abrupt stop as you enter this
room.  The darkness present in the maze seems to be here to such a degree
that you feel blinded by the infinite amount of shadow.  The presence of
evil continues to grow stronger, you must be getting close.

A Dimly Lit Tunnel~
You are nearly overcome with the presence of tremendous evil.  Howls of
torment can be heard far off in the distance.  The caverns continue to the
south, but ponder your mortality first, should you continue?

A Dimly Lit Tunnel~
The sound of rushing water seems to be coming from farther up the
corridor.  The evil assaulting your soul continues to get stronger with
every step you take.  You feel yourself tense, expecting maybe the ruler of
hell himself around the corner.

A Bend in the Tunnel~
The sound of rushing water gets louder, perhaps there is a stream or
river up ahead.  This part of the caverns seems to glow with an unholy
light, and although it is nice to have light again you start to think you
prefered the darkness over this.

A Dimly Lit Tunnel~
Light shines forth from the walls of this room, but it is an unnatural
and queer light.  The sound of a river is stronger now and you assume that
it can not be much farther up ahead.  You may continue through the caverns
to the south or return towards the exit, north.

The End of The Caverns~
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!  You've found the entrance to the River Styx, and
Hell. I am sure the demons look forward to having you over for dinner.
