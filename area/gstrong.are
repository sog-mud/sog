The Entry Hall to the Goblin Stronghold~
You step into a cavern chiseled from solid granite. The first thing
you notice is the stench. You see goblins everywhere, clad for battle.
Perhaps they are training for an assault on Midgaard, as they have been
spotted outside the South Gate more and more frequently. Whatever their
purpose here, you must put a stop to it. You see a hallways leading east
and west, and a set of great doors to the south.
   There is a small (Glowing) (Huming) tablet.

North End of the Great Hall~
This mighty vaulted cavern seems much too fine to have been crafted by
the likes of what you see here. Walls are built from carved granite blocks
which must weigh over a ton apiece. The smooth rock arches up to a perfect
semi-circular stone ceiling upon which a great battle scene is painted.
Tapestries and paintings line the walls, but these have fallen into
disrepair at the hands of the goblin occupants. A long mahogany dining
table stretches for a full twenty yards, well into the south end of the
Great Hall. You now notice that the subjects of the artwork here are
dwarven, not goblin. Perhaps the goblin legions overran this fortress and
drove the dwarves out. In any event, your work has just begun. The guards
have noticed you. You better be ready. The Great Hall continues south, with
doors east and west.

King Grumm's Throne Room~
Chaos reigns in the court of King Grumm. Jesters, dancing girls,
officious-looking goblins, and a myriad of other distractions compete for
the time of the king. The Throne Room is a perfectly-round chamber with
a large statue of a heroic-looking dwarf in the centre. Once again,
tapestries line the walls, portraying battles and glory. If it was possible
to instil more chaos into this carnival atmosphere, you have succeeded. The
king leaps to his feat, and goblin guards bar your escape back south. Grumm
dosen't look like he wants to talk! There is a doorway to your east, and
another to the west.

Goblin Training Room~
This is where the goblins are shaped into something resembling a
fighting unit. Assorted dummies and training equipment lie around. The room
has a sticky film of blood on the floor. Apparently the goblins believe in
the Darwinian theory of military training.

Goblin Barraks~
This room is where the goblin soldiers sleep. The room is a full 20
yards square and there are bunks along each wall. There is graphic
graphitti scrawled on the walls, but it's in goblin and all you can make
out are the drawings of goblin females. There is an arched doorway leading
north.
