A Dark Path Through The Forest~
You suddenly realize that the forest around you has changed drastically. 
The once bright day is now quite overcast and dull. A sharp wind suddenly 
picks up and brings a cool chill to your bones. All around you you hear the 
chilling sounds of the forest, almost like it was out of a story book. 
The dusty road continues north and south, winding around a curve up ahead, 
making the end of the road, or what it will bring to, impossible to see. 
A large sign is here, demanding your attention. (look sign)
     There is a small (Glowing) (Humming) tablet.

A Long Dusty Trail~
The path continues, and the view is still not as interesting. The sky has 
become more dark and it appears that the clouds are filled with rain. 
The faint smell of autumn; the rotting of leaves on the  moist forest floor, 
adds to the quaint scene. A rustle in the trees above you finally shows life 
in the dreary forests. The path turns and continues west, north  and south
back to the lighter forests. To the north you see a nice lake.

A Clearing in the Woods~
Suddenly the path comes to an open section on the road. You realize that 
mountainous peaks stab sharply into the sky, creating a look of might, a look 
of power. Lush green plants can be found in all directions, speckled with the 
odd reds and yellows of the wild flowers. A small brook trickles alongside the
path, adding a harmonious tune with the soft whistle of the scarcely know Grey 
Bird. A soft mist whisps slowly past, cascading over the brook, creating 
a beautiful soft atmosphere. 
The path continues west and east.

A Steep Path Down-Hill~
The bright warm sunshine seems to lighten your heart, as you notice you 
have lost all sense of direction. The quaint small brook that followed you 
from the east, is slowly gaining speed. Mountains of all sizes tower up sky-
high above you, creating a wonderous view of the lands. The crisp cool air 
seems to add new strength to your sore old bones. The path continues west 
and back east.

Alongside A Wild Waterfall~
So much for a quaint little brook. The what once was small brook is now 
a raging waterfall, crashing and thumping against the rocks, as it visiously 
works its way, still of to the north of your path. You notice the mountains 
seems to encase you in a valley, forever growing taller and more mighty with 
every step. A dark green moss seems to cover the trees about you, camouflaging
the wild animals of the woods. It seems as though these trees and plants are 
older than time itself, yet have never aged a day. The ground is covered in 
soft brown pine neddles, matting you heavy footsteps. Several large boulders 
are scattered here and there throughout the woods. The path continues west and 
back east.

A Sharp Bend in the Road~
You come face to face with a mighty mountain wall, blocking your path. You 
feel like you have waisted all your time and effort just to get here, to find 
a dead end. Right before you give up you notice a flicker of movement to your 
right. You turn, yet you see nothing. Suddenly you realize a small matted path 
curves around the mountain, almost like a deer trail. Perhaps you should 
follow it to see where it takes you. The path continues north, through the 
deer trail, and east, where you came from.

The Windy Deer Trail~
You are on a windy deer trail, which seems to swirve thisway and that. 
The sounds of the forests are about you, weaving together in a harmonious tune,
with the wind in the trees as its melody. The soft mist on your face seems to 
wet your boots aswell, adding to the special touches of the woods. Annoying
little spider webs seem to stick to your face and clothes, making this trip 
very much unejoyable. Up ahead you see that the path widens. The path 
continues west and south.

You notice that the path suddenly widens, making it easier to avoid every 
branch and root that comes your way. You notice that the ground has turned 
to a lose gravel and begins to be flater than before. The masssive wall of 
the mountain suddenly looms up to your left, and up a head you notice that 
it juts out, almost creating a dead end. The path continues west and east.

At a Quaint Little Bridge~
Well, you were right. The wall of the mountain does jut out and block your 
path, but a quaint little bridge lies to the north, created by a human, or 
some other creature. It seems quite stable and safe to cross. A beautiful brook
trickles slowly underneath the small bridge, creating a relaxing sound. The
forest seems to be more lush on the other side of the brook. The path continues
north, across thr bridge, or east, back to the path.

On The Quaint Little Bridge~
As you cross the little bridge you notice how well made it really is. Below 
you the silver and quartz reflecting off the sunlight brings a relaxing sigh. 
A small rainbow trout jumps out of the water, landing with a splash so big it 
gets your shoes wet. This sure is a nice spot. The trail continues north, off 
of the bridge, and south, back to the path.

On The Other Side of The Brook~
You have made it past the peaceful bridge and are now on a woodchip covered 
trail. The peaceful sounds of the Blue Birds and the joyous chatter of the 
chickmunks add to the beauty of these lands. The tall Oak and Mapple are just 
some of the numerous trees you recognize. Beautifully lush ferns fill the gaps 
between trees; a little Red Juliefire sprouting out here and there, giving the 
forest floor a wider variety of color and beauty. In the distance you hear the 
rushing of a waterfall, and the loud soulfull cry of the Black Crane. The path 
continues west and back to the bridge south.

The Long Path Continues~
As you continue to walk down this glorious path, you notice that the sounds 
of the waterfall are getting louder and clearer. The sun plays shadow games 
with the wind through the trees, lightening your heart with joy. Deep in the 
bush you see a bright red Pinion bird, rare to all parts of the world save 
the most beautiful. The trees and plants seem to almost glow with peace.
This is such a beautiful place, you never wish to leave. A soft breeze lifts 
your hair and brings you the fresh scent of Golden Wildflowers, making you 
wish you were in a sunny field, rolling in them. But you still would much 
rather be here. The path continues west and east.

The Great Lookout~
You are standing about 300 feet above the raging rapids of The River of 
Venis. You realize that the trees did a great job consealing this massive 
cliff. Right beside you there is a massive rading waterfall that tumbles down 
at a gloryous speed. It is amazing how powerful these falls are. A well 
crafted bridge swings the span of the cliff, right in front of the waterfall.
You would hate to make a mistake and take a step off the bridge. The path 
continues out south across the bridge, or back east to the trail.

of what lies below, a 300, perhaps more, foot drop to your death. Still the 
white foam at the bottom looks as soft as clouds, and the speed of the falls 
brings a cool, freesh breeze. Just being this high up is so exhilerating, you 
could stay here for ever! The bridge continues south or back to the solid 
grounds, north.

The Druid Lord's Secret Study~
You have stumbled into the most beautiful room you have ever seen! giant 
slabs of white marble with the accasional greyish streak through them cover 
every bit of the floor, save for the far south of this room, which has 
a gloryious carpet, telling the tales of several great battles, all woven 
into the magical design. Tall book shelves cover the eastern wall of this 
cavern; books of lore, magic, spells, ceremonies and much more. A giant
oak desk lies infront of the bookshelves, covered with paper and all of 
Xavier's work. A light blue chair rests in the northern corner. A thin line 
of glass-like whater cascades down the western opening creating a magical 
window. Etched in stone high above this wonderous site are the words 
'Mirror of The Worlds'. You gaze into the light white waters and see your 
past. Despite being inside a dark cave, this study seems to be quite 
comfortable. Several bright torches line the walls, and one giant blue flame 
floats magically in the top-most center of the cave. Magic just seems to flow 
through this cave, magic beyond your wildest wonders. You wonder where the 
exits are.

Boy, it sure does feel good to be back on hard solid ground once again. 
Tulips and Rose bushes line the pathway, adding once again to the beauty of 
this strange land. The tall trees seem to give off the right amount of shade, 
to keep you from getting too hot in this sun. The path you are one is kind of 
like one you would have up to your house; big enough for one or two people,
long and curvy. The mountains loom even higher in the distance than they ever 
had before. You can tell that each step takes you down hill, into a vally of 
some sort. The land about you appears as though it was formed ages ago, due 
to earthquakes and storms. The path continues north to the bridge, or south

The beautiful land before you seems to reach out for miles, all encased 
in a wonderous valley. It would be interesting to see what this place is

You are now walking on a stone walkway to a very fancy house. Nicely trimmed 
flowers and bushes lie in neatly tended patterns along the dark green grass 
at the fron of the house. The house itself is huge and white. It appears to be 
two stories high, and it looks to be as though this house belonged to a Lord
or a Lady, or someone with LOTS of money. You wonder who would live in such

there are more than one Inn on this island. You better hurry, they may be

doing business, heading in or our of the city, basically, keeping quite busy. 
The floor is covered in a light green carpet, rolled out endlessly along the 
floor. Crystal clear windows are along the side walls and several torches 
light the ceiling above. The smell of pitch burning reminds you of your 
grandmothers cottage, in the early Winter. The path continues north and south.

put together! You wonder where the best Inn would be. It would be nice to

@eng You have entered the town center, an major intersection in the roads. 
You see by the signs that mark the streets that if you followed the road west 
it would take you to the palace, south would take you along the southern main 
roads, and east would take you to several other intersections and shops. Which
way shall you chose? North, East, South or West?

selling his icecream. To the south you notice several stools and tables

that say 'Employees only.' This is a really nice shoppe and you would really

room. This is the most busy store you have seen all day! Dark red carpets 
cover the floor; light blue pain covers the walls. To the north you notice

Dark grey stone paves the street beneath you, adding to the affect of 
the monstrous city. Tall buildings loom up around you, sparking your intrest 
in every direction. The daily noise of the villagers is starting to become 
just another sound in the background. This is by far one of the best cities 
you have ever come across, and you wish never to leave. To the north you see a
quaint little container shop. To the south and old-fashioned library. 
To the west the road continues, and the east will take you back to the market 
square, eventually.

You have walked upon a beautiful little room; wooden floors and walls, and 
many many windows allowing light to flow in. You notice that shelves line 
the walls, filled with containers of many different sizes. You see a large 
table with a man standing behind it, selling his grade A containers.

You have come upon the one and only library of The Valley. Giant shelves 
filled with books souround the walls of this huge buidling. Many tables and

set of stairs with a bookshelf lining it, leads to an upstairs balcony. 
A large sign overhead says "Shhhhh....Its a Library...." informing you to

A Secret Passage Behind The Bookcase~
Upon lifting a great book on Titan lore, the bookcase opens infront of you, 
leading into a secret passage. You quickly scrambled in, with the bookcase 
closing shut behind you. Very dim torches light this stone corridor, making 
it almost impossible to see. It seems to be a dead end, or at least it needs 
a key to get back into the library. You wonder what mysterious things lie 
ahead, where does the path lead to, where shall you end up? The only exit is 
west, and back north to the balcony.

the torches are lit, but they seem to be glowing a deep orange, sort of like 
Titan magic. The dark path leads ahead to the west, going into the unknown. 
You can always head back, in hopes someone will open the door, like you did. 
But the chances of that happening are very slim. The only exits are west

to cry, though perhaps you shouldn't. You wonder what is there for you lieing 
west of the three-way passage, but you feel mighty tired for any surprizes 
or letdowns. Before you give up all hope, you notice a small little door near 
the ground. No, not a door but a grate leading out side! You beed down to get 
a closer look. *sniff* The smell! Garbage! It leads to the garbage dump! You 
wish there was another way but, 'Que sera, sera'...'whap happens, happens.' 
The exits are north, through the grate to the garbage dump and south to the
