-1 DIKU~
.                    Original game idea, concept, and design:

~
-1 GOLD SILVER MONEY~
Midgaard's economy is based on gold and silver coinage (and the lowly copper,
which you as an adventurer are far too proud to carry).  Gold coins are worth
100 silver coins, but are also four times as heavy (25 to the pound, as 
opposed to 100 to the pound for silver). Gems can be bought to alleviate weight problems
from the Midgaard jeweller, he charges a mere 10% more than they are worth.
10 gems weigh one pound, and they can be worth more than 100 gold pieces for
the highest quality stones.
~
0 BRIEF COMPACT~
Brief and compact help set your display options for the game. Typing brief
toggles on and off the showing of room descriptions when you move around
(considerably reducing the text to be processed), and typing compact 
removes the extra blank line before your prompt.
~
-1 DEAF~
The deaf toggle turns off incoming tells, helpfull if you are being bombarded
by messages from other players.  You can still use reply (see 'help reply') to
reply to people who were telling you before you went deaf, although you
cannot reply to a deaf person unless you or they are a diety (it's mostly 
useful for sending a quick "I'm being spammed so I went deaf" message to
a person).
~
0 PROMPT~
Syntax: prompt
Syntax: prompt all
Syntax: prompt <%*>
 
PROMPT with out an argument will turn your prompt on or off.
 
PROMPT ALL will give you the standard prompt.
 
PROMPT <%*> where the %* are the various variables you may set yourself.
 
        %h :  Display your current hits
        %H :  Display your maximum hits
        %m :  Display your current mana
        %M :  Display your maximum mana
        %v :  Display your current moves
        %V :  Display your maximum moves
        %x :  Display your current experience
        %X :  Display experience to level
        %g :  Display your gold held
        %s :  Display silver carried
        %a :  Display your alignment
        %y :  Display your percent hit
        %o :  Display opponents percent hit
        %r :  Display the room name you are in
        %e :  Display the exits from the room in NESWDU style
        %R :  Display the vnum you are in (IMMORTAL ONLY)
        %z :  Display the area name you are in (IMMORTAL ONLY)
        %n :  Display your name
        %S :  Display your sex
        %t :  Display current MUD time

Example:  PROMPT <%hhp %mm %vmv>
        Will set your prompt to "<10hp 100m 100mv>"

~
0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
of Midgaard.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose depends on 
your then experience points, your race, class and your previous deaths.

After each three deaths your constitution decreases by one.

Corpses decay after time, but the objects inside corpses fall to the ground.

~
0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set 
amount of experience points for each level based on your race and class.
You gain experience by:

    being part of a group that kills a monster

You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.
    A group which consist of two player will reduce your experience points 
25 % of real exp which got if alone.
    A group which consist of three player will reduce your experience points
50 % of real exp which got if alone. 
~
0 COLOR COLOUR ANSI~
Syntax: color              Toggles color mode on/off

You may also talk in color; the format is like this: the 'escape character'
to specify a color is the left handed brace '{{', following that you should
use one of the following numbers,

         {x{{x     reset, returns to default

         {r{{r     red     {m{{m     magenta
         {g{{g     green   {c{{c     cyan
         {y{{y     yellow  {w{{w     white
         {b{{b     blue    {D{{D     grey{x

For brighter colors, use the shifted letters: {RR{GG{YY{BB{MM{CC{WW{x
When using color, it looks better if you finish the line with whatever
color it would normally be in, such as a gossip, the color is magenta, so:
                {mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world{m'{x
        looks better than:
                {mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world'{x

Other {{? sequences are:
         {{*     beep    {{\     new line
         {{z     reset to previous color

Color is courtesy of Lope from Loping Through The MUD.

~
0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  

Area resetting happens roughly every 106 sec. if no one is in the area;
less often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on
the ground will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

-2 NAME~
NAME POLICY:

realms of Muddy, you must choose a name accordingly explained below:

ACCEPTABLE:
1)  Proper names, medieval or modern. i.e  (Takasi, Mitra)
2)  Created names with a medieval or fictional sound.  (Priatros, Sansoles)

Last decision depends upon Immortals of Realms of Muddy. Do you accept? ~
0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~
0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.

it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.
 
COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.
 
COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~
0 FLEE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

If you are affected by pass door spell then you can flee passing the 
closed doors.

You cannot flee to inside of the clans when you are fighting with the 
clan guardians.
 
If you are Samurai, after level 10 you can NOT FLEE,so be careful.(You may 
flee if victim's level is much higher than your level (level difference is
6). But you won't wimp out.)

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~

Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand

regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.

magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

These commands may require an item skill to be succesful, see the help entries
on the skills scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.
~
0 CONSIDER~
Syntax: consider <character>

Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

~
0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and object. The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving. Typing save
will block all other command for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.
You do not need to save. Every save operation requested by the players 
causes lag. The Muddy' auto saver does not cause even a tiny lag.

Some objects, such as keys and some maps, may not be saved. Those very 
powerful items of very limited number, are not saved if you are below 
level 10.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game 
you will be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~
0 RECALL /~
Syntax: RECALL

RECALL prays to gods for miraculous transportation from where you are

below level 10, by only their praying. You must be calm enough to 
concenterate and pray to the gods, so you are not able to pray not 
only in the fights, but also sometime after a fight. Those who are over 
level 10 must find a way to cast the spell to recall.

RECALL costs half of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse may not recall at all.
~
-1 SPLIT~

a hero. But the hero's corresponding skills must be 100% and hero must
be in teach mode.

~
0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <str int wis dex con>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

It takes one training session to improve an attribute.
You receive one session per five levels.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train
WIS and CON both to 18 before practising or training anything else.
 
~
100 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~
100 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~
98 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
        ban     <site> <newbies|all|permit>
        ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner.

A site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set
by editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site.
*s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or 
content (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidently lock out too many
sites with a wildcard.  Bans do not save unless the permban command is used.
~
99 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~
Syntax: reboot
        shutdown

Reboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

Shutdown prevents the normal 'startup' script from restarting server after
reboot.
~
96 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~
Syntax: wizlock
	newlock

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to Muddy. Wizlock locks
out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 91), except for link-dead players
who are returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation,
typically used for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should
be avoided,and newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to the imps.

A god must be at least Supreme level to wizlock the game.
~
99 DENY~
Syntax: deny <name>

Deny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their character
name unusable.  It may only be removed by editing the file, for this reason
freeze is usually preferred.
~
97 DISCONNECT~
Syntax: disconnect <name>

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet
prompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying
players.
~
97 FREEZE~
Syntax: freeze <name>

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a 
troublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.
~
93 FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.

Below level 97 (Deity) force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is
unavailable.  You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example. 

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.
~
96 SOCKETS~
Syntax: sockets
	sockets <name> 

SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including 
users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the 
channel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in 
merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.

The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used
to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched
into an orc).
~
96 LOAD~
Syntax: load mob <vnum>
	load obj <vnum> <level>

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to 
duplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum
command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are
put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old
format objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new
format objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.
(see also clone, vnum, stat)
~
98 SET~
Syntax: set mob   <mobile> <field> <value>
	set obj   <object> <field> <value>
	set room  <number> <field> <value>
	set skill <char>   <name>  <rating>
	set skill <char>   all     <rating>

The set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data
structures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.
Set skill all (pc's only) will set all the character's skills to the value
given.  Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile.
(see also string, stat)
~
95 STRING~
Syntax: string obj <field> <string>
	string mob <field> <string>

The string command changes the various strings associated with an object or
mobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string
mob.  Sorry, multi-line strings are not yet supported.

Syntax: nochannel <character>
	noemote   <character>
	noshout   <character>
	notell    <character>

Noemote, noshout, and notell are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those
forms of communication.

The nochannel command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim
from using any of the channels (gossip, cgossip, Q/A, music) on the game.
Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.
~
96 PURGE~
Syntax: purge
	purge <character>

Purge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes all the
NPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges one
character from anywhere in the world.

Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag
set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Hassan).  Mobiles may be
purged if they are called directly by name.
~
96 RESTORE~
Syntax: restore <character>
	restore room
	restore all

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.  It also heals poison, plague, and blindness.

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every player
in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. Restore all
is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore should be used sparingly
or not at all.
~
97 SLAY~
Syntax: slay <character>

Slay kills a character in cold blood, no saving throw.  Best not to use this
command on players if you enjoy being a god.
~
95 TRANSFER TELEPORT~
Syntax: transfer <character>
	transfer all
	transfer <character> <location>
	transfer all         <location>

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all 
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer. 
~
94 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command>

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).
~
94 ECHO GECHO PECHO~
Syntax: echo  <message>
	gecho <message>
	pecho <character> <message>

These commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message to
all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent
it.  Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho
sends the message to the player specified as the target.  Any higher-level
god will see a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it
is an echo.
~
92 GOTO~
Syntax: goto <location>

Goto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain
god level.

Implementors can use the violate command to get into private rooms.
~
92 HOLYLIGHT INVIS WIZINVIS~
Syntax: holylight
	wiznvis <level>

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will mke you invisible to all players of
a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum
(your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 100 characters are totally 
invisible.
~
92 INCOGNITO~
Toggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people outside the
room you are in, but leave you visible to those who are with you.  It takes
a level argument similar to wizinvis, people at that level or higher can see
you regarless of location.
~
92 MEMORY~
Syntax: memory

Memory reports the size of your mud.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.
~
96 VNUM~
Syntax: vnum <name>
	vnum <obj or mob> <name>
	vnum skill <name>

Vnum finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints out
the results.  Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is
very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and
the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name.
(see also load)
~
93 STAT~
Syntax: stat <name>
	stat mob  <name>
	stat obj  <name>
	stat room <number>

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room 
(if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are
standing in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.
(see also goto, transfer)
~
93 MWHERE~
Syntax: mwhere <name>

Mwhere shows you the locations of all mobiles with a particular name.
~
95 PEACE~
Syntax: peace

Peace causes all characters in a room to stop fighting. It also strips the
AGGRESSIVE bit from mobiles.
~
92 POOFIN POOFOUT~
Syntax: poofin  <message>

'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages
must include your name somewhere in the string.

Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you.
(see also goto)
~
99 PROTECT~

Protect is used to protect a character from unwanted snooping.  Removing 
protected status from a character WILL be seen by that character.
~
95 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
	log   all
	snoop <character>

Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.
Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied
by mail to the implementors.

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell the imps.

Snoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time. Try to respect privacy.

Snoop yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
~
94 SWITCH RETURN~
Syntax: switch <character>
	return

Switch switches you into the body of another character (who must not
already have a descriptor, e.g. you can't switch into a PC). You also cannot
switch into link-dead PCs.

~
91 IMMTALK :~
Syntax: immtalk <message>

Humans are the most common race in the world, and make up the majority of
adventurers.  Although they have no special talents like the other races,
they are more versatile, being skilled in all classes.  Humans are able to
gain more benefit from magical devices.

~
-1 DWARF DWARVES~
Dwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for foul temper and great
stamina.  Dwarves have high strength and constitution, but poor dexterity.
They are not as smart as humans, but are usually wiser due to their long
lifespans.  Dwarves make lots of noise wherever they go and cannot be
thieves.  Dwarves can be good or neutral.

the paths to the Underdark have been found.  Slighty larger than their 
surface cousins, these gnomes are also stronger and a little more hearty from
centuries of working stone.  The dedication to stone has made them not  
quite as adept mentally as their cousins, but yet they are still regarded 
as very wise.  With their singular dedication to the stone, svirfnebli 
must be neutral in all  aspects of their lives.  They have the same ability 
in learning the powers of items as their surface cousins.

~
-1 FELAR~
The Felar are a race descended from the great cats. For long years in their
past, the Felar were enslaved by wizards to serve as familiars.  The scars
of this servitude still show in the relative weakness and dull wits of the
Felar.  They are renowned, however, for their agility and their "nine lives".
It is said a Felar can withstand blows in battle (or from an angry master)
that would kill a human outright.

The thick fur of the Felar makes them resistent to cold, but also very
vulnerable to fire.  They also abhor water and are liable to drown in it.
Despite heavy modification by their former masters, the Felar retain the
large claws and fangs of their ancestors.  This gives them the ability to
inflict extra damage during a fight, but the claws are not retractable so
it is difficult for a Felar to walk unnoticed.  The Felar are also famed for
their street fighting ability.  The Felar do not have the discipline or wits
to be pure magic-users, and some of the Felar still resent the mages, anyway.
The wars of freedom were long ago, however, so many younger Felar are willing
to forgive and forget, and some have even begun to dabble in the magic that
once imprisoned them.

~
-1 DUERGAR DARK-DWARF DARK-DWARVES~
With the recent excavations unearthing paths to the Underdark, the race of
dark dwarves known as Duergar has made its way into Muddy.  Like their
surface cousins they are strong, though their evil ways have changed them
in other areas.  Unlike their cousins, they are not known for working stone
and metal, something which has made them less hearty over time.  They have
become more dexterous through centuries of thievery and deceit.  All Duergar
are evil.

-1 TROLL TROLLS~
Long hidden within the sanctity of their mountain caves, a race known in the
past only as a myth, lies the civilization of the trolls. Built with the 
undying stamina of the mountains they reside in, these green skinned beasts
often grow to obtain a state of health few other races believed possible.

have decided as a whole to rejoin the races of the realms, moving out of
their sanctuaries in numbers reaching high into the thousands

-1 RANGER RANGERS~
RANGER
Outdoorsmen, hunters, master of woodcraft, Rangers are the guardians of 
the forests.  In addition to having excellent fighting skills, they are
also wielders of some powerful magic.  Some Rangers have been known to call 
large bears to their aid, fashion mystical staves, and be able to camouflage
beyond detection.  Their ability to ambush opponents makes them deadly 
foes.

~
-1 NINJA NINJAS~
NINJA
Masters of the art of weaponless combat, these mysterious warriors have
recently become more common in the land.  They strike quickly and
silently before fading into the shadows.  Ninjas are skilled in the
knowledge of nerve pressure, and can weaken their foes with a well placed
strike.  Wielders of a dark magic, they have spells that no wizards of
today can duplicate.  At high levels, Ninjas learn the art of
assassination, killing their foe instantly and silently.  Due to their
belief that touching the blades of their opponent with their own blade is
a loss of honor, Ninjas cannot parry with swords.

~
-1 ANTI-PALADIN ANTI-PALADINS ANTIPALADIN ANTIPALADINS ANTI~
- ANTI-PALADIN -
The opposite of Paladins, these knights have chosen evil as their course.
Such fervor and zeal gives them deadly spells to compliment their already
superb fighting skills.  They seek only personal gain and to cause suffering
and pain to good.  Anti-paladins must stay evil in order to cast their 
spells. Those who forsake evilness are frowned upon.

~
-1 PALADIN PALADINS~
These warriors have chosen the path of virtue and chivalry above all others.
This dedication to their cause grants them priest-like spells and healing
powers.  They are also formidable fighters, always questing to stamp out evil.
Paladins must stay good in order to cast their spells.  Those who forsake
goodness are frowned upon.  Paladins are expected to be truthful, 
chivalrous, humble, merciful, kind, bold, and noble of spirit.  Paladins 
must be Lawful Good.

~
-1 CLERIC CLERICS~
Clerics are the most defensively oriented of all the classes.  Most of their
spells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few combat 
spells being far less powerful than those of mages. However, clerics are the 
best class by far at healing magics, and they possess an impressive area of
protective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.

~
-1 THIEF THIEVES~
Thieves are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other class,
but have the widest range of skills available.  Thieves are specialists at
thievery and covert actions, being capable of entering areas undetected where
more powerful adventurers would fear to tread.  They are better fighters than
clerics, but lack the wide weapon selection of warriors.

~
-1 WARRIOR WARRIORS~
Warriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best fighters
of all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the magical
talents of mages and priests.  Warriors are best for those who don't mind
taking the direct approach, even when another method might be called for.

~

size increase, they gets damage from light, and their damroll increases. You
cannot realize a vampire in nights. It is only written "An uggly creature".

all alignments. Ofcol is neutral only. Your hometown is where you will 
recall to and is where the pit is to which your corpse will decay. 
Everyone starts at mud school, which is connected to each of the hometowns.

~
-1 ETHOS~
You may pick a Lawful, Neutral or Chaotic ethos.  This shows your opinion
toward the laws of the land (not the rules).  If you plan on obeying the
laws no matter what, you take a lawful ethos, if you will obey the laws
some of the time, then you are neutral.  If you plan on breaking the laws
and only obeying them when you just happen to obey the laws, then you are
chaotic.  Ethos can only be set once.

~

See also: ROLEPLAYING GROUP ALIGNMENT
 
~
0 ALIGNMENT~
In the interest of attracting the right caliber of followers, the
immortals of Muddy have outlined the following alignments.  See where
you think you fit in.

Lawful Good:   An orderly, strong society with a well-organized government
	       can make life better for the majority of the people.  To ensure
	       the quality of life, laws must be created and obeyed.  When
	       people respect the laws, and try to help each other, society as
	       whole prospers. 

Lawful Neutral:  Also believes in a strong, well-organized government, whether
	       it is a tyranny or democracy.  Organization and regimentation
	       bring benefits that outweigh any moral questions raised by
	       their actions.

Lawful Evil:   The use of society and its laws for personal benefit.  Structure
	       and organization elevate those who deserve to rule as well as
	       provide a clearly defined hierarchy between master and servant.
	       Laws and societies are supported so long as they fit with
	       personal concerns.  Laws are obeyed out of fear of punishment.

Neutral Good:  A balance of forces is important, but the concerns of laws and
	       chaos do not moderate the need for good.  The universe is vast
	       and contains many creatures striving for different goals, so a
	       pursuit of good will not upset the balance.  Fostering good may
	       mean supporting an organized society, or overthrowing the
	       existing social order.  Social structure has no innate value.         
  
True Neutral:  Almost impossible to find such people as the majority of people
	       make judgments.  It is their duty to see that all of the forces
	       (evil, good, law, and chaos) remain in balance.  Alliances with
	       such people are odd, as they tend to switch sides as one side
	       brings the other to the point of destruction.

Neutral Evil:  The primary concern for such people is their own advancement.
	       Working with others or on their own, their only interest is 
	       getting ahead.  Such people are known for their 'Me, Myself,
	       and I' personalities.  No scruples, no conscience.

Chaotic Good:  Strong individualists marked with a streak of kindness and 
	       benevolence.  Goodness and right matter, but there is little
	       use for laws and regulations.  Their actions are morally good
	       but may not be in perfect agreement with the rest of society.
					  
Chaotic Neutral:  There is no order to anything, even their own actions.
	       Good and Evil are irrelevant when making a decision.  They
	       are almost totally unreliable, except for the fact that you
	       can rely on them being like this.  The true coin-flipper, they
	       rely on fate and chance to lead them.

Chaotic Evil:  The bane of all that is good and organized.  Laws and
	       governments are the tools of weaklings unable to fend for
	       themselves.  The strong have a right to what they want, and
	       weak are there to be exploited.  Leadership among CEs is based
	       on power, with the leader capable of bullying his underlings
	       into obedience.  

Each god may accept a follower based on these outlines.
~
0 FOLLOW GROUP NOFOLLOW NOFOL~
Syntax: follow <character>
	group
	group <character>
	nofol 

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within 8 levels of
your own. Groups of 2 and 3 get experience bonuses.  See "help experience".

NOFOL is a toggle which makes you no longer accept followers.  This also
causes all people and mobs from following you at that time including who
you are following.  Type NOFOL again to reset the toggle back to accepting
followers.  No one can follow you when this toggle is set.

~
0 RULES~
These are the rules of the Realms of Muddy. Disobeying is grounds
for deletion. For other matters, use common sense.

1. Remember that this is a roleplaying atmosphere.  If an immortal imposes
   their will upon you, you must do it.  Do not ask a wizi-invis god 'who they
   are'.  This is question is considered rude and will not be answered.
2. Immortals often make announcements via notes, and you are required to 
   follow accordingly.  Not having read the notes is no excuse.  It is the 
   same as if the Immortal told you in person.
3. Player stealing and killing is permitted and encouraged.
4. Do not use charmed pets to PK people who are out of your PK range.
   If a person is not in your pk range, and they do not initiate an attack on
   your group member, then your pets had better not touch them.
5. Your presence here is a privilege not a right.  Obey any orders from gods,
   and you will be fine.  
6. MULTICHARRING: You may have more than one character, but you may not use
   multiple logins from same terminal. Punishment for this rule is
   deleting of one char.
7. Anyone who assists people in multicharing, i.e. holding equipment while
   they transfer it, 'looking the other way', etc will be punished harshly.
8. DO NOT, in any way, shape or form, exploit bugs.  It WILL result in a
   punishment determined by IMPLEMENTORS.  Repeat DO NOT exploit bugs, you 
   WILL be IMMEDIATELY punished.
9. SPAMMING IS ILLEGAL.  (Spam filling up someone's screen with needless 
   repetion of anything)  You will be given one warning and then deleted.
   Don't do it.
10. Sexual harrassment will not be tolerated.  If both parties do not consent
    to the socials/emotes, then don't do them.
11. Cheating will not be tolerated. This includes accepting favors from
    gods and exploiting bugs.
  
  These are simple, clear rules.  If you violate them you WILL be
  punished.  Punishments may vary, depending on previous rules violations, 
  the situation.  Be prepared for the worst if you are caught breaking 
  these rules.

  Changes  to these rules are at the discretion of the immortals, and
  may be done withoutwarning, notice, or even evidence of sanity.

~
0 LAWS LAW ~
The laws of the land that shall be enforced by the Ruler Clan are as
follows :
 
    The areas that are defined as protected by the jurisdiction of the Law
are the entirety of Midgaard, New Thalos, Valley of Titans and  New Ofcol.

1. No Player Killing/Stealing/Looting in any protected area.  Theft is fully
   illegal.  This includes the attempt of stealing any from a person OR looting
   a player's corpse OR looting the pit when a player's equipment has returned
   from their decayed corpse.  Stealing also includes taking a disarmed weapon
   or equipment during a legal duel that is not your own.  Looting a criminal's
   corpse is unlawful within the towns.  You will be held responsible for your
   groupmate's actions.
 
2. No offensive area spells or harmful powers will be used in any protected
   area.  This includes area spells from charmed, summoned or attacked mobs.
   Aggressive mobs may not be summoned/brought into any protected area.
								       
3. Aiding known criminals in any way by directly giving them equipment,
   helping them to elude punishment, to kill Ruler guards, etc.
   will result in a WANTED flag.
								       
4. Intrusion into the Ruler Clan is considered illegal and an attack upon
   the laws themselves.  

5. A dispersal that teleports the victim from a protected area directly into
   the room of an aggressive mob that causes their death is considered a
   player kill and will result in a WANTED flag on the caster.

6. Garbling Ruler members is against the law.  This prevents them from
   doing their job and is considered an offensive attack upon the law itself.

 Enforcement of these laws will be carried out by Ruler members. Midgaard,
New Thalos, Valley of Titans and New Ofcol are defined by the 'where protector'
command. Old midgaard is not a holy town.

~

~
0 PHILOSOPHY ~
Here is a general philosophy of each of the known clans.

Ruler:  The enforcement of the laws above all.  The world exists in two
	halves: right and wrong.  The law comes first in all respects.
	They control and decide what is lawful or not.  Their word is law.

BattleRager:  BattleRagers live for combat, and look down on those who need    
	      magic to survive.  They have a strong aversion to mage magic,
	      and are very wary of clerical magic.

Chaos:    Chaos wants to spread chaos throughout the land.  Not necessarily
	  evil, just against the orderwed society.  They feel that laws and
	  rules hamper freedom, and will go out of their way to see them
	  broken, or to cause chaos.

Knight:   Honor is valued above all else.  These fighting warriors seek to
	  right injustices and correct wrongs.  They follow the ideals of
	  the paladin. 

Shalafi:  In Dark-Elf language, it means 'Master'. Discipline brings power.
          This is the motto of the Masters of Arcane Arts. The advancement 
          of the Art is their motivation.  They look down on physical combat, 
          preferring to use their magic.

Invader:  Invader is born to invade or massacre.  Establishment of its power 
          over all is its goal.  Invader, in short, wants to control the world, 
          but would never do so openly.

Hunter:   Mercenary of Muddy. These pupils  kill any mobile and player
	  with the money that they will want. You may hire any of hunter
	  for above purpose.

Keep in mind these are only general guidelines.

Diff = max - min.  Mean is the arithmetic mean.
The values in parenthesis are the the standard merc values.
~
0 MANADICE~

standard merc values.  (Will be put in when there's time to calculate
them...)
~
0 RESETS~
Syntax: RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> <location on body>    - equips last mobile
        RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> inside <obj vnum>     - store in container
        RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> room                  - store in room
        RESET <number> MOB <vnum> [<max #>]             - load a mobile
        RESET <number> DELETE                           - delete a reset

RESET alone will display the resets in the current room.  The <number> will
be displayed with this list.  Typing ? WEAR-LOC will list possible locations
that an object can be loaded to.  The [<max #>] is the maximum number of
mobiles allowed in this room and will default to 1 if no number is entered.

For resets to be successful make sure that you add them in a logical order.
For example if you are equiping a mobile don't load a container in the room
and fill it with some objects and then continue equiping the mobile.  It is
likely that resets will backfire if they are not carefully entered.

If you wish to reset the room then use EDIT ROOM RESET.
