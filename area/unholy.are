This statue isn't very well-fashioned, and isn't very attractive. You wonder

a master~
A monk clad in black robes with silver edging sneers contemptously at you.
~
The master monks are the teachers and supervisors of the monks of the abbey,
and answer only to the abbot himself. They are if anything more diabolical
than their demented pupils, and twice as deadly.

A frail old man clad in purple robes casts evil incantations here.

The abbey employs several necromancers to create their legions of undead,
with which they one day intend to conquer the kingdom of Malathar. They are
horrid, twisted, decrepit old men, who have incredible magical powers.

The monks frequently summon devils to aid them in their evil schemes, and
their favorite is the bone devil, who only demands seven virgins rather than
the many scores other devils demand.

The Path to the Craggy Tor~
You are ascending steadily upwards through rough terrain towards a large,
jagged mountain far to the north. There is a small rock resting here, near
the path, which could serve as a passable chair. There is a sign nailed to
a dead tree that hangs over the rock.

You reach the edge of the chasm, and stare across at the Tor. Sure enough,
you can see the abbey, nestled in a small crack that divides the top third
of the tor in two. It appears to have no doors or windows, and you can't
see any way across. You think you can see a black shape nestled atop the
abbey.

The Edge of the Chasm~
You are heading round the edge of the chasm. You can see no way across it
from here, though you could perhaps proceed across or down if you could
fly. You can still see the Tor, and the abbey at its summit. The black
shape is still hovering atop it.

worked by a bone golem. It seems a rather puerile protective measure,
considering most intelligent adventurers wouldn't be fooled. YOU weren't

A greenish glow is coming from the north.

A Long Black Corridor~
This corridor is dark, almost supernaturally so, and you make your way along
slowly and carefully. You see a door to the south.

The Necromancers' Labs~
You walk into a dank, smelly chamber full of tables stacked with body parts.
Feeble illumination comes from a weak light spell cast on some rods of
mithril; besides that the room is almost completely dark. Doors lead east,
west and north.

The Cells~
Here the Necromancers store the results of their twisted experiments on some
captured elven knights. They howl and scream so much that even their
creators are scared of them.

A Cell~
This dismal chamber contains little but a few rags and scraps of flesh and
bone. Whatever lives here certainly has bad domestic habits.

The Final Portal Chamber~
This 40'x40' room has the usual two portals, save that here there is no
lock on the one set in the roof. In fact you can walk right into it from
here should you so desire. Hmmm...

Arched hallways run east, south and north, while a door bars passage westward.

The Arched Corridor~
you slowly walk along the passage. An eerie feeling comes over you, and you
shiver. Distant chanting can be heard, as well as the occasional tolling
of a large bell. You hear more chanting, then a terrible scream. Oh dear...

The West Wing of the Unholy Chapel~
You are standing in the west wing, among pews stained with blood and other
fluids, most of them unidentifiable. A great cry goes up to the east. You
peer in that direction and- OH MY GOD!

The Unholy Chapel~
It is here that the monks perform their unholy rites, summoning unnameable
horrors from the deepest pits of hell. You see sick murals covering the
walls, depicting the sacrifice of youths of all races to perverted, twisted
demons and devils.

The Altar~
You have reached the core of the evil, and the wicked heart that pulses the
energy through it. Though you have battled scores of opponents, rarely have
you previously encountered such evil. Foul ichor spews from gashes in the
walls of this place, coalescing into a floating portal to some netherworld
you know naught of. But you soon will, for it is there that you must next
travel, to rid the world of this evil!

The Inner Sanctum~
You have entered the quarters of the Abbot, master of the unholy abbey and
the foe you have dreaded facing the most. You can stop here to prepare for
the upcoming battle if you desire.

The Quarters of the Abbot~
These rooms, as you expected, are lavishly appointed with rich tapestries
and fine furniture from all over the world. You didn't think the abbot would
live so simply as his followers! You see a bathroom to the east, a study
to the south and a massive bedchamber to the north.

A Bedchamber~
This room is dominated by a great pile of rugs and cushions in the center
of the room, upon which the abbot reclines with whatever servant has taken
his fancy. At present it appears to be deserted...

A Study~
This study is more of a library, filled as it is with scores of grimoires
detailing the most despicable acts imaginable. A small desk, not dissimilar
to those you saw the maste rmonks using below, stands in the center of the
room, near a fireplace which burns magically without requiring fuel.

from some hidden source. It appears to be palatable, surprising in this
foul place.
