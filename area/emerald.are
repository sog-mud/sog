Dryad~
a dryad~
A dryad peers at you inquisitively from behind her tree.~
With her slim fingers she holds her tree protectively as she looks at
you, her brown eyes full of innocence and curiosity.  As you approach
her she looks startled and disappears into the tree, only to appear on
the other side of it moments later to smile at you shyly.  The dryad
is just slightly taller than 5 feet and has the eternally beautiful
and youthful features of the faerie folk.

Nymph~
a nymph~
A nymph looks coyly at you, then winks mischeviously and dances away.~
Her long hair is wet, as if just splashed with the waters of a crystal
brook or stream.  Her movements are full of grace and wild abandon as
she dances along the forest path.  You hear laughter like the sound of
running water and you cannot be sure if it is her singing or a brook
in the distance.  She calls out to you to join her in her dance.

Pixie~
a pixie~
A small pixie stands here laughing cheerfully.~
A small, knee high little pixie looks really engrossed with the
activities of the Pixie-Brownie Bonanza. Not believed to exist by
most of the normal folk of Thera, he is clad in soft green leathers
and cloth and wears a small cap with a proud rooster feather sticking
out. Not looking at them directly, he seems to be eyeing one of the
brownies.

This brownie seems totally oblivious to your presence, and she seems
quite happy to continue chatting merrily to her friends. Slightly
shorter than pixies, the brownies have a reputation of wit and
cheeriness with a touch of mischief. Like most brownies, she has
pretty elvin features, and is dressed totally in brown. She wears
no cap, her otherwise long hair tied in a pony-tail.

Iachimo is a spiteful prankster who often annoys the residents of the
Emerald Forest.  He sets fires at the roots of trees, poisons the
streams and bites the pixies and brownies.  He doesn't have a good
bone in his spindly body and the forest would be well rid of him.
He unleashes a torrent of curses at you.

most of the participants. This particular Pooh-Ba seems to have a
bit of halfling blood in him, for he towers almost a head over the
pixies and brownies. He is dressed in large and flowing green-brown
robe, and seems rather busy with his duties.

spared the tricksters or thieves of the larger towns. Her basket is

    I heard a wild flower
    Singing a song:
    I slept in the earth
    In the silent night
    I murmur'd my fears
    And I felt delight.
    In the morning I went
    As rosy as morn
    To seek for new Joy
    But I met with scorn"

Marisa~
The Enchantress of Yrn seeks out her ancient nemesis.~
Marisa of Nag'Yrn is the chosen of Yog-Sothoth. She wears a samite
gown of the purest white, her long flame-red hair tied up in an
elaborate top-knot. A wretched look of cruelty crosses her young
face as she contemplates the death of her nemesis, the Bandit King
Imbessar. She has tracked him to the Emerald Forest and it is here
that they will have their last battle.

a lady ranger~
A beautiful lady is talking to some animals here.~
This woman seems (quite impossibly) to be having a conversation with
the animals of the forest! Two blue jays, a squirrel and two rabbits
are chittering and chattering and her smiles, laughter and responding
noises suggest that it is a merry conversation. Possibly elven or
half-elven, she looks about the age of a young human maid of twenty
years, her long blond hair fall gently over her shoulders making
her strikingly beautiful.

A small pixie stands here laughing cheerfully.~
A small, knee high little pixie looks really engrossed with the
activities of the Pixie-Brownie Bonanza. Not believed to exist by
most of the normal folk of Thera, he is clad in soft green leathers
and cloth and wears a small cap with a proud rooster feather sticking
out. Not looking at them directly, he seems to be eyeing one of the
brownies.

large squashed pumpkin has some how been animated by evil sorcery.
It holds its boney hands out-stretched and seems to be asking you
for a dance.  A tango perhaps, or a foxtrot.

There is a fiendish donkey munching on marshweeds here.~
The fiendish donkey looks sallow-skinned and mean-spirited. Most of
them eventually end up roasted, toasted or flambed on some demon lord's
banquet table.  This one looks set to give you a good kick if you won't

 "O me! what eyes hath Love put in my head,
  Which have no correspondence with true sight;
  Or, if they have, where is my judgement fled,
  That censures falsely what they see aright?
  If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
  What means the world to say it is not so?
  if it be not, then love doth well denote
  Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no.
  How can it?  O! how can Love's eye be true,
  That is so vex'd with watching and with tears?
  No marvel then, though I mistake my view;
  The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.
  O cunning love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,
  Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find."

You feel like throwing it away.
@rus "Протяни мне губенки, мой маленький птенчик,
 Положи мне ручонку туда, куда надо,
 Пусть твой голос звенит, как хрустальный бубенчик,
 И глаза зеленеют, как плод авокадо.
 
 Я сейчас поцелую ресниц твоих венчик,
 Чтоб слегка погасить блеск лукавого взгляда,
 Не крестить нам с тобою детей, человечек,
 Ну а нехристей нам и подавно не надо.
 
 Солнце, девочка, звездочка, деревце тонкое,
 Как же мне с тобой мило, легко и свободно!
 Как приятно зарыться с такою девчонкою
 В то, что для зарыванья с девчонкой пригодно.
 
 Поцелуй мою страшную старую харю
 И не бойся меня, я тебя не ударю."

care has been taken to keep it clean, shiny and whole.
@rus Пара поножей с зарубками от ударов, от которых они спасли своего хозяина.
Мелкоячеистая кольчуга, конечно, защищает несколько хуже, чем полная броня,
но зато гораздо меньше стесняет движения. Владелец заботливо относился
к ним во время своих путешествий, и эти поножи не раз защищали его от
увечий.

of Sacrifice.  It almost seems as if dwarfed shades are dancing across
its surface.  Runnels of dried blood stain the altar to its centre,
which has been staved in with the imprint of a monstrous cloven hoof.
@rus Мерцающий факел, освещающий поляну, отбрасывает дрожащие тени на алтарь.

@eng A Fog-Shrouded Trail@rus Окутанная туманом тропинка~
@eng You are on a fog-shrouded trail which runs up the side of this dark
mountain.  The ground is wet and muddy with melted snow, and the path
which should lead to the Miden'nir disappears amongst the mist and the
trees.  There is nothing for you to do but follow the trail that twists
up towards the broken, snow-covered heights of the mountain range.
An old stone tablet with inscriptions stands beside a bush in the
corner.
@rus .  Ты стоишь на окутанной туманом тропинке, которая бежит вокруг горы. Земля
мокра и грязна от тающего снега, и путь к Миден'ниру исчезает среди деревьев и

вершинам этой горной гряды. Старый каменный знак (tablet) стоит за кустом.

@eng The snow begins to fall thickly as you enter a pine forest in the
mountains.  The burnt remains of two log cabins lie in a clearing
about a dozen yards off the path.  There is a disconcerting silence
in these woods, an oppressive lifelessness that makes you want to
leave them immediately.  The trail stretches through these haunted
woods up the side of the mountain and down through the fog to the
foothills of the range.

к вершинам горной гряды.

@eng A Signpost in the Enchanted Forests@rus Указатель в Заколдованном лесу~
@eng Through the majestic oaks of these ancient woods, the deep earthiness of
the forest permeates your senses, while a gentle hum of magic in the air
pulses low and vibrant.  A shy nymph peeks inquisitively at you from
behind a tree before disappearing with a titter.  An old but sturdy
signpost stands beside a crossing in the paths, which lead in every
direction.
@rus .  Среди этих царственных дубов, странное чувство магии витает в воздухе.
Застенчивая нимфа подглядывает за тобой из-за дерева. Заметив, что она
обнаружена, нимфа исчезает, звонко рассмеявшись. Старый, но сделанный на века
указатель (signpost) стоит на перекрестке путей, ведущих на все стороны света.

@eng A Fae Crossing@rus Волшебный перекресток~
@eng The path has taken you to a junction over which hangs the twisted
branches of two Blackthorn trees and an Elderwood tree.  You remember
folktales which tell that spiteful faeries lurk under the meetings of
such trees to waylay and confound woodland travellers.  Feeling a little
uncomfortable, you look south, where the forest seems to darken
menacingly.  The east trail beckons you to the safety of the Emerald
Forest.
@rus Дорога привела тебя к перекрестку, где сплетаются ветвями кусты терна
и бузины. Вспоминаются сказки о злобных феях, живущих в таких местах,
о том, как эти феи сбивают с дороги лесных путников. Чувствуя себя
несколько неуютно, ты вглядываешься на юг, где лес угрожающе темнеет
Дорога же на восток ведет в спокойный Изумрудный лес.

@eng Road to the Vale of Clover@rus Путь к Долине Клевера~
@eng You are on an old road which runs alongside a clear stream.  It leads
to the Vale of Clover, a small valley at the foot of the mountains.
Looking down the road, you see a small village nestled beside a bend
in the stream.  Tall heather blows in the wind and you see some cows
grazing idly nearby.  The road east runs down into a wooded dell.
@rus .  Ты идешь по старой тропинке, стелющейся по берегу кристально чистого
ручейка. Дорога ведет тебя к Долине Клевера, небольшой долине у подножия
гор. Смотря вперед, ты замечаешь маленькую деревушку, стоящую у изгиба
ручья. Ветер колышет высокий вереск, поодаль несколько коров неторопливо
жуют траву. На востоке тропинка скрывается в лощине.

fresh and filled with the scent of flowers.  There are some quaintly-
appointed cottages painted in bright colors on either side of the road.
You hear ringing laughter to the east, where a country path winds up a
hillock.  The village square lies to the north.
@rus Тихая деревня Клеверякино очаровывает своей безмятежностью. Воздух
чист, только ароматы цветов наполняют его. Ярко раскрашенные домики
причудливо разбросаны по обеим сторонам дороги. С востока слышится
звонкий смех, но небольшой бугорок скрывает смеющихся. На севере видна

@eng A Green Hillock@rus Зеленый холм~

folk of Clover have their picnics.  From the sound of manly crooning
accompanied by girlish titters, you deduce it also where the local lasses
receive the attentions of their suitors.  Scattered trees and trimmed
hedges provide the green with shadynooks and pivate arbors.  The
hillock continues north, while the path west will take you back to the
village.
@rus .    Склоны холма занимает великолепный луг. Похоже, жители Клеверякино
часто ходят сюда на пикник. Послушав хрипловатое мужское пение, 
сопровождаемое звонким девичьим хохотом, ты понимаешь, что здесь местные
красавицы получают знаки внимания от своих ухажеров. Деревья и кусты,
растущие тут, позволяют желающим найти укромный уголок. Пригорок
продолжается к северу, путь на запад приведет тебя обратно в деревню.

@eng A Secluded Corner of the Meadow@rus Укромный уголок на лужайке~
@eng You are in a quiet corner of the meadow, well-shaded by two large cypress
trees.  Though empty now, it seems a likely spot for young couples to
exchange professions of love, undisturbed by friends or irate parents.
Having no time for such adolescent frivolities, you quickly scan the
countryside and note that from this vantage point, you can look over the
entire village of Clover.  You espy a dirt track which leads west from
the village and then turns north to a ruined abbey.
@rus Ты стоишь в уединенном уголке лужайки, в тени двух старых кипарисов.
Хотя сейчас здесь никого нет, это место кажется специально созданным
для юных пар, желающих обменяться признаниями в любви вдалеке от
назойливых родителей или друзей. Не имея времени для подобных 
юношеских удовольствий, ты оглядываешься и замечаешь, что отсюда
хорошо видна вся деревня Клеверякино. Ты видишь старую дорогу, ведущую
на запад к полуразрушенному монастырю.

tree lends its shade to two old men who are sharing a large tankard of
cider.  You see a large farm to the north and a beaten dirt track to
the west.
@rus Двое фермеров воздвигают знак с надписью "Фестиваль урожая" рядом с
тобой. Несколько женщин оживленно обсуждают последние сплетни и
слухи, а их дети в это время беззаботно гоняют лопоухого игривого
щенка. В тени яблочного дерева двое пожилых мужчин неторопливо пьют
сидр из больших кружек. На севере видна ферма, но еще одна дорога

freeman and entrepreneur - seems to be having a little trouble keeping
his livestock in order.  His chickens are harrying his ducks in the
duck pond, while a big brown shaggy dog is chasing his pigs around the
entire farm.  From inside a blue and yellow farmhouse you hear Princess
Yaruga, the farmer's wife, shouting angrily in a foreign tongue.
@rus Ты стоишь на пороге весело раскрашенного амбарчика. Хотя нет, похоже,
это жилой дом. Старина Грифф, фермер, свободолюб и весельчак, не слишком
много времени уделяет наведению порядка в своем хозяйстве. Цыплята теснят
утят в пруд, а огромный лохматый пес гоняется за свиньями по всему
подворью. Из сине-желтого домика доносится голос Принцессы Яруги, жены
Старины Гриффа, зло кричащей на непонятном языке.

@eng The trees seem to hang back in fear as you walk into a wide clearing in
the witch wood.  The clearing is dominated by a broken stone altar that
is caked red and black and the blood and grime of centuries of evil.
The torches that hang from the boles of the trees ringing the clearing
throw a halflight on a deep hole in the altar.
@rus Кажется, даже эти мрачные деревья отступили в ужасе, образовав эту
поляну. Почти всю ее занимает огромный черно-красный алтарь, окрашенный,
похоже, кровью и сажей за многие века жертвоприношений во имя зла.
Факелы, свисающие со стволов деревьев, окружающих эту поляну, едва
освещают глубокую дыру посередине алтаря.

@eng The Witch Wood@rus Ведьмин лес~
@eng You are in the eerie domain of the Weird Sisters.  Ghost lights flicker
palely about your feet and cast a shadowed eye on a variety of rotting
plants and animals that cover the forest floor.  The twisted thorn trees
groan at your approach, and you are aware of a slow hissing that seems
to taunt you from the cover of darkness.  To the south a fog rolls out
onto a dead marsh.
@rus Ты $gn{попал} в мрачные владения трех сестер-ведьм. Призрачные огоньки
бледно мерцают на земле. Странные пугающие тени пляшут на растениях
и животных, кишащих на земле. Кривые колючие деревья скрипят когда
ты проходишь мимо них, а от шипения, доносящегося из темноты, кровь
стынет в жилах. Куда ни глянь - этот ужасный лес кажется бесконечным.

@eng The Entrance of the Witch Wood@rus У входа в Ведьмин лес~
@eng Your uneasiness mounts as you walk along this haunted stretch of road.
The mist clears, and you find yourself in a nightmarish forest.  The
empty husk of a dead nymph lies at your feet, and on either side of you,
the trees look twisted and tortured into unnatural shapes.  The depths
of the forest sends up a hopeless cry to usher you into the woods that
ring the edge of Hell.
@rus Твое беспокойство растет по мере того как ты идешь по этой населенной
призраками тропе. Туман расступается, и ты видишь себя в кошмарном лесу.
На земле лежат останки мертвой нимфы, деревья по обе стороны дороги
неестественно изогнуты, как будто в страшной агонии. Из глубин леса
доносится безнадежный крик, заманивая тебя в этот богом проклятый лес

@eng Under Dark Woods@rus Рядом с темным лесом~
@eng The path continues darkly under rows of Elder trees.  A crooked road
leads west through a tangled hedge of briars.  A mist prevents you from
looking beyond the hedge, but you sense a powerful and oppressive evil
reaching out towards you with cold and clawed fingers.  To the south,
the forest seems to lighten considerably, and you are about to leave
in that direction when a tattered parchment, flapping weakly in the
wind, falls at your feet.
@rus Тропинка петляет между мрачными старыми деревьями. Почти незаметная
тропинка ответвляется на запад и уводит в густой колючий кустарник.
Туман не дает тебе разглядеть, что происходит за кустарником, но ты
чувствуешь сильное, древнее зло тянется оттуда к тебе холодными
пальцами. К югу, лес становится гораздо светлее, и ты уже почти $gn{готов}
пойти на юг, когда ветер бросает тебе под ноги какой-то старый
свиток (parchment).

parchment~
@eng (Parchment: It is yellowed and seems savagely ripped from a tome.
 "... I mouthed a prayer for my fallen brother Alandro as I raised his
  morning-star to smite the foul witch who had struck him down.  But I
  had reckoned without her Sisters, and the twain now flew shrieking
  towards me.  The first, diabolically transformed, pinioned me to the
  ground, while her corrupt breath drove the sight from my eyes and
  caused boils to burst from my skin.  The other, whom I had seen to be
  beautiful but terrible even as I was made blind, wrested my weapon
  from me and tore at my face.  I know not how I fled from their cursed
  abode, but the relief I felt then at my escape was vainly felt, for
  even now, I nightly suffer the torments of their evil blandishments.
  In my sleep I see myself being chased at the edge of a black abyss by
  the Devil's huntsmen and their hellhounds slavering for my soul.  I
  wake up drained, I feel both my faith and my sanity slipping from me.

  We had been foolishly proud, thinking we could destroy those servants
  of evil alone.  Now we are undone, and the relic of our Holy Saint is
  lost forever.")

@rus Бумага пожелтела от старости, похоже, это страница из дневника
   
"... и я вознес я молитву за душу моего павшего брата, Аландро, и поднял
 выпавшую из его руки булаву, и обрушился на отвратительную ведьму, что
 убила его. Но не видел я ее сестер, и еще две ведьмы, пронзительно
 крича, бросились на меня. Первая, почти превратившаяся в демона,
 приковала меня к земле, дым ее дыхания ослепил меня, а пламя обожгло
 кожу до волдырей. Другая, прекрасная и отвратительная настолько, что
 я видел это даже будучи ослепленным, выхватила мое оружие и устремила
 его мне в лицо. Я до сих пор не могу понять, как я смог убежать из
 их проклятого обиталища, но облегчение, как оказалось, было 
 преждевременным. Даже сейчас, по ночам я страдаю от их проклятого
 обольщения. Во сне, я чувствую, как Демоны-охотники гонят меня все
 ближе и ближе к краю пропасти, порабощая мою душу. Я просыпаюсь в
 холодном поту, и чувствую, что вера и разум мои с каждым часом все
 слабее...
    Мы были столь самоуверенны, думая, что сможем победить это зло.
 Теперь мы пропали, и наш святой талисман потерян навсегда..."

@eng You are on a forest trail that runs in all directions but north, where
the forest skirts the sheer mountain face.  Dew-covered hawthorn bushes
flank the east trail, along which several rangers are walking.  It seems
to be the woodkeepers' outpost.
@rus Ты стоишь на перекрестке тропинок, ведущих на юг, запад и восток. На севере
лес упирается в почти отвесный склон горы. Дорожка на восток уходит в покры-
тый росой колючий кустарник, вдалеке ты видишь нескольких хранителей леса.

while others are tending to injured woodland animals.  The Guildmaster's
cabin lies to the north, while several smaller cabins lie to the south.
A fair-sized lodge sits beneath a Redwood tree to your east.
@rus Знакомый ренджер поприветствовал тебя как только ты $gn{вошел} на поляну.
Удивительно, как он сумел тебя заметить? Часть хранителей собираются
уйти в свое ежедневное патрулирование по лесу, остальные оказывают
помощь раненым животным. На севере ты видишь хижину мастера-лесника,
на юге стоят несколько хижин поменьше. Нора достаточно большого размера
уходит вглубь между корней огромной секвойи.

@eng In the Emerald Forest@rus В Изумрудном лесу~
@eng A circle of blue-capped mushrooms form an old faerie ring by the side
of the path you are on.  On certain nights of the year, the faerie folk
wander out into such rings for wild dances by the moonlight.  It is
said that mortals who are drawn into the dancing circle on such nights
can be held captive by faerie food or a faerie's kiss and made to dance
on and on for a period of seven years.  You hear a titter of laughter
from the branches of a tree, but when you look up you see nothing.
@rus На обочине дороги ты замечаешь правильный круг, образованный
неизвестными тебе грибами с ярко-синими шляпками. Иногда, ночами
волшебный народец собирается в таких местах и отдается волшебному
танцу. Предания гласят, что люди, оказавшиеся в такое время рядом,
могут стать жертвой поцелуя кого-нибудь из фэйри, и тогда этот
человек тоже начнет танцевать. И он не сможет остановиться семь
лет и семь зим.

@eng Before the Great Tree@rus Перед огромным деревом~
@eng You stand at the perimeter of the largest, most incredible tree that
you have ever laid eyes on.  It has gold-flecked leaves that are the
size of small horses, with thick roots supporting a massive trunk that
is easily twice the size of the grand fortress of the Templar Knights
of Renhorden.  It seems to stretch endlessly into the sky, and you
wonder why you did not see it towering above all the other trees in
the forest.  You long to inch closer, but cannot seem to move beyond
an invisible barrier that keeps you about a hundred yards away.  You
see movement and lights in and about the tree, but there seems to be
no way you can get closer to it.
@rus Ты стоишь рядом с самым огромным деревом, которое ты когда-либо
видел. Его листья, зеленые в золотистую крапинку, достигают таких
размеров, что за таким листиком может укрыться небольшой пони.
Толстые корни поддерживают могучий ствол, который невозможно не
только обхватить руками, но даже и измерить шагами будет весьма
тяжело. Дерево уходит ввысь, и кажется, что его вершина скрывается
где-то за облаками. Ты $gn{удивлен}, как ты $gn{мог} не заметить его
раньше, ведь оно намного выше любого другого дерева в этом лесу.
Ты хочешь подойти ближе, но на расстоянии около ста метров неви-
димый барьер преграждает тебе путь. Рядом с деревом ты замечаешь
какие-то движущиеся огоньки.

@eng You follow the stream to a limpid pool where the waters lap gently
against the rocks.  Large ferns provide shade from above and the petals
of brightly-colored flowers float in the pool.  Sitting on the moss-
covered rocks by the pool is a slim young girl dressed in green.  She
has long black hair and elfin features, a yew bow slung across her back.
She seems oblivious to your presence and hums softly as she passes her
hand through the waters.
@rus Поднявшись по течению ручья, ты добрался до прозрачного водоема.
Вода в нем нежно омывает каменные берега. Высокие папоротники дают
прохладную тень, и разноцветные лепестки цветов колышутся на воде.
На покрытом мхом камне сидит стройная юная девушка, одетая в зеленое.
Ее заостренные уши прикрыты каскадом великолепных черных волос, а
из-за спины виден крепкий тисовый лук. Она, похоже, не замечает твоего
присутствия и продолжает что-то негромко напевать, водя рукой по

hear the distant roar of a waterfall to your south.

@eng A majestic waterfall pours from high above the mountains to the south.
Great torrents of water crash down on the rocks in a wide pool, and even
where you stand in a shaded glade, the wind blows sprays of water into
your face.  A profusion of flowering shrubs grow at the edge of the
pool.  In a large shaded retreat made by the overhanging branches of
silver oak trees stands a likeness of Altariel, the Lady of the Woods.
At the base of the waterfall, a rock pool with crystal clear water has
formed.
@rus Величественный водопад низвергается с вершин высоких гор, которые

through the wood paths of the Emerald Forest.  The angry face of a

@rus Ты стоишь на перекрестке трех дорог посреди леса. Ползучие лианы

tree.  The poplar tree stands here beside the stump, its branches cut

while shafts of sunlight turn the forest floor into a carpet of gold and
green.  The woodland trails running through this area of the forest seem
well-kept, yet untravelled.
@rus Красота этих зеленых лесов очаровывает тебя, и ты уже $gn{готов} остаться здесь
навсегда. Ласточки поют высоко, над кронами деревьев, сквозь которые проби-
вается яркий солнечный свет, превращая землю под ногами в волшебный ковер из
зеленых и золотых листьев. Тропинки, вьющиеся между деревьями, ухожены, хотя
по ним, похоже, нечасто ходят.

@eng You are at the head of a long north-south road in the forest.  The
Greenbrier bushes that grow beside the path have shed their heart-shaped
leaves on the road.  All is quiet here.  To the north, dark Elder trees
loom out ominously.  The road continues south.
@rus Ты стоишь в начале дороги, идущей с севера на юг. Кусты шиповника,
растущие по обе стороны дороги, устлали ее своими листьями. Тишина и
покой вокруг. На севере лес темнеет, шиповник сменятся бузиной. Дорога
идет на юг.

weeds are dry at the edge of the mound and the grass that grows here is

дуб стоит на холме, как маяк, словно отталкивая то зло, что населяет
этот лес.

while to the south the forest continues on with oak, pine and
rosewood. Peering intently toward the source of the sound, you
notice a faint outline of a bridge resting in the shade of the long
leafy branches of the tall, flanking trees.

@eng A Shady Bridge@rus Тенистый Мост~
@eng You stand on the western end of a wooden bridge in the Emerald Forest.
It's origin is a mystery, but the fine detail and craftsmanship it bears
would rival even the most cunning of woodsmiths.  The branches of the
tall trees that grow on the banks of the stream cover the bridge in a
soft cool embrace while a breeze flows in from the north.  Huge salmon
and rainbow trout weave their way amongst the rocks in the stream below.
To the west the forest stretches on, while the sounds of laughter and
play drift in softly from the south.
@rus Ты стоишь на западном конце деревянного мостика.  Имя его строителя
скрыто покровом старины, однако качество работы и красота резьбы может
поспорить с лучшими образцами работ резчиков.  Ветви деревьев, растущих на
берегу этого ручья окутывают мост приятной тенистой прохладой, легкий
ветерок дует с севера.  Две большие рыбы, похожие на лососей проплывают
между камнями в потоке, текущем под мостом.  Тропка теряется в лесу на
западе и идет через мост на восток.

@eng The Shady bridge@rus Тенистый мост~
@eng You stand on the eastern end of a finely crafted wooden bridge. It's
edges have small engraved runes carved into them, and the wood
is probably a form of pine or oak from the Emerald Forest itself.
Lacking the dull weathered tone and creaking of most wooden
bridges, it spans across a fairly wide river flowing in a north-south
direction. The height of the surrounding trees provide a pleasant
shade from the noon-day sun.
@rus Ты стоишь на восточном конце этого деревянного мостика. На его концах
вырезаны руны, а сам мост сделан, похоже, из сосны или дуба. В отличие
от большинства деревянных мостов, этот не скрипит под ногами и даже как-
то сохранил цвет свежеобработанного дерева. Под мостом с севера на юг
протекает достаточно широкий ручей. Высокие деревья вокруг создают прият-
ную прохладную тень даже в полдень.

@eng You are following a small woodland trail in the Emerald Forest. The
hear the sound of moving water to the west, and squinting a bit
intently you see a blurred outline of a small wooden bridge in the
distance. Who built that bridge? And why? Only a few seasoned rangers
have ever come this deep into the enchanted wood, and none ever
mentioned the existence of construction of a bridge. As far as you
know, the forest has resisted gently but firmly all attempts at
colonisation or lumbering, which makes it quite a curiousity.
@rus Ты идешь по тропинке в Изумрудном лесу. Звук текущей воды доносится
до тебя с запада и, присмотревшись, ты видишь вдалеке мостик. Кто его
построил, когда, зачем? Самое удивительное, что никто из твоих знакомых
хранителей леса никогда не упоминал о мосте в этой части леса. Этот лес
всегда сопротивлялся попыткам его колонизации.

remain silent, at least to your ears while the aroma of fresh woodland

a proper tree house.  Nevertheless, it is very cosy and could accomodate
two quite comfortably.  A pot of jasmine tea is simmering over a fire
and a few plush cushions are scattered on a rug in one corner.  On a

another book lies half-read on the floor.
@rus Это скорее небольшая платформа с четырьмя стенами и листьями вместо

ние сочинений Шекспира, одна книга лежит на полу, прочитанная наполовину.

@eng A Small Clearing@rus Небольшая поляна~
@eng You stand in a small clearing deep in the Emerald Forest. The ground
shows no evidence of trees being cut down or any other indication
that the clearing is carved from axe or hand, yet the borders seem too
neat to be the result of Mother Nature's whim. In some areas the
shrubs and bushes appear to have gone out of their way (if that is
possible) to align themselves, and the soft wood grass while not having
the blunt heads of a kept garden seem to be growing neatly in line all
by themselves. Strong magic is at work here.
@rus Ты стоишь посреди небольшой поляны в Изумрудном лесу. Не видно никаких
следов того, что эта поляна появилась после вырубки деревьев. Однако, у
нее слишком ровные границы, чтобы ее можно было назвать капризом природы.
В некоторых местах кусты и деревья, кажется, сдвинулись со своих мест, чтоб
встать рядом со своими собратьями. Даже трава под ногами, похоже, растет
рядами. Тут не обошлось без магии друидов.

clearing. From where you stand you can see small movement and
curious sound which you can't quite make out. The tree branches
sway softly while you decide your next course.
@rus Ты стоишь на кривой лесной тропинке, и тропинки поменьше ведут
на все четыре стороны. Пойдя на север, восток или юг, ты углубишься
в лес, тогда как восточная тропинка приведет тебя на небольшую
поляну. Оттуда, как тебе кажется, доносятся весьма любопытные звуки,
однако ты не можешь определить их происхождение. Ветви деревьев
мягко колышутся, словно пытаясь подсказать тебе, куда пойти.

@eng Two lines of pixies and brownies stand facing one another yelling
and hooting in excitement. They seem to be deep in a game of
'Pixie, Brownie and Honey Bun'. A small bag filled with pipeweed
seed is placed squarely in the middle of the line, while both teams
are numbered off. A number is called, and the respective brownie
or pixie has to run forward, grab the bag and return to the line
without being touched. Looks like great fun.
@rus Пикси и брауни выстроились в две линии и играют в интересную
игру. Ровно между двумя командами лежит мешочек, а члены обеих
команд пронумерованы. Судья называет число, и соответствующие
игроки бросаются к мешочку. Побеждает тот, что вернется с мешком
к своей команде неосаленным. Очень занимательно.

запад или восток. Путь на юг быстро заканчивается, упираясь в подножие
крутого утеса, по его гладкому склону невозможно взобраться. Весело
звучат песни птиц и голоса животных.

@eng A Forest Trail@rus Лесная тропинка~
@eng The somewhat ragged west-ward forest trail makes a sharp right and
southernly turn here, making further travel to the west difficult
if not impossible, would be safer to backtrack and find another
path instead of hacking through the notoriously resilient trees of the
Emerald Forest. A tall tree with huge leafy branches branches stands
here tempting you to take a break and rest in it's shade.
@rus Извилистая бегущая на запад тропинка делает резкий поворот на юг.
Дальнейшее продвижение на запад трудно, а скорее всего и вовсе
невозможно. Лучше найти другой путь, чем прорубаться через могучие
деревья Изумрудного леса. Большое дерево с огромными покрытыми листьями
ветвями приглашает отдохнуть в тени.

@eng A Dwindling Forest Path@rus Дикий лес~
@eng The forest path begins to dwindle here.  It's obvious you've entered
a part of the forest seldom visited by anyone.  You notice the richness
of the flora here, with a wider and thicker range of herbs growing in
wild abandon across the ground or in small cul-de-sacs formed at the
roots of the oak trees.  You hear a rustle in the bushes, but staring
intently without trying to look too obvious, you notice nothing.

@eng A Lovely Trail@rus Тропинка~
@eng You are following a faint north-south trail in the Emerald Forest.
Swallows and Bluebirds fill the air with song and laughter, and you
spy a small red-breast Robin sitting motionless on a branch on one of
the oak trees. The serenity of this forest is amazing, you feel at
peace and safe, as though you just stepped into a fairy tale where
the knights kill all the trolls, and nobody stays hungry. It's hard
not to day dream, walking here.
@rus Ты идешь по едва заметной тропинке в Изумрудном лесу. Ласточки и
синешейки весело поют, перелетая с дерева на дерево. На ветке одного
из дубов ты $gn{заметил} красногрудую малиновку, она сидит почти неподвижно.
Спокойствие этого леса восхищает, ты чувствуешь себя мирно и спокойно,
как будто попал в сказку, где рыцари убивают злых троллей, принцессы
спасены, и все сыты. Тяжело не замечтаться, прогуливаясь тут.

@eng The Tombstone@rus У могилы~
@eng There is something rather peculiar about this part of the Emerald
Forest. A small tombstone sits in the middle of a small clearing.
Carved from a white substance, it's shiny surface reflects what
little sunlight that manages to escape from the umbrella covering
of trees surrounding the grave. Freshly picked flowers lie at the
foot of the tombstone, while strange symbols are lovingly engraved
on it. The strange thing is there are no paths leading from or to the
area, which would puzzle even the most observant elf or ranger. Who
would pick flowers for a lone grave and leave no evidence of passing?
@rus Что-то странное и непонятное есть в этом уголке Изумрудного леса.
Небольшая могилка расположена посередине этой поляны, высеченный из какого-то
камня монумент стоит у ее изголовья. Его отполированная до зеркального блеска
поверхность отражает тот слабый свет, что пробивается сквозь густые кроны
деревьев, окружающих поляну. Свежие цветы лежат у подножия памятника, на
самом же памятнике есть какая-то надпись. Странно, что не видно следов, ни
ведущих к памятнику, ни от него. Загадка, способная заставить задуматься даже
мудрого эльфа или искусного ренджера. Кто похоронен здесь? И кто приносит
цветы, не оставляя следов? Эти вопросы кружатся в твоей голове.

@eng The Wood-Path@rus Лесная дорога~
@eng The Wood-path you're following gets more pronounced and used here,
a testimony that the Emerald Forest isn't populated (or at least
explored and travelled) only by it's original furry or buzzing citizens.
Multi-coloured flowers dance gaily in the wind while clinging to the feet
of the tall oak and pine trees flanking the forest road. Flying
squirrels leap from branch to branch, probably searching for a
delicious cashew or two.
@rus Лесная дорога, по которой ты идешь, становится более заметной тут. Ею
гораздо чаще пользуются, и ты догадываешься, что Изумрудный лес населен
и исхожен не только его исконными пушистыми аборигенами. Разноцветные
цветы образуют затейливый узор, прижимаясь к высоким дубам и соснам,
развесившим свои раскидистые ветви на дорогой. Белки перелетают с ветки
на ветку в поисках орехов.

@eng Woodkeeper's Clearing@rus Поляна лесника~
@eng The path ends in a medium sized clearing. A small wooden sign states
quite dogmatically "WoodKeeper's Clearing. Forest haters not welcomed.
Orcs, Bugbears and Goblins keep out!". A number of elves and humans
dressed in a mixture of green and brown stand around here engaging in
friendly conversation. The actual Keeper's Meet hasn't started yet,
apparently there are rangers from distant woodlands still trying to
make it for the meeting. A pile of scrolls sit on a small table,
probably pamphlets to be distributed to the arriving participants of
the meeting.
@rus Путь заканчивается на поляне не слишком большой, но хорошо освещенной. Неболь-
шая деревянная табличка привлекает твое внимание. Подойдя, ты читаешь : "Это
поляна только для тех, кто любит лес. Оркам и Гоблинам вход строго воспрещен."
Несколько людей и эльфов, одетых в зелено-коричневой гамме, стоят и весело бе-
седуют между собой. Встреча хранителей леса еще не началась, видимо все ждут
представителей из дальних стран, торопящихся на встречу. Стопка бумаги (scroll)
лежит на столе, вероятно, ее раздадут приехавшим.

@eng Thick green vines form an impossible barrier to the south.. There is
no reason to doubt that these vines possess the same ability to
block even the most determined machete-armed lumber-dwarf then all
the others. What does seem a bit strange, however, are faint footsteps
leading up to the vines and abruptly stopping. Could they merely be
tracks from an age past, now lost to the world and found only in time
and memory?
@rus Толстые зеленые лианы преграждают путь на юг. Нет сомнения, они остановят даже
самого настойчивого дварфа, вооруженного мачете. Но как ни странно, ты заме-
чаешь следы, идущие к этой зеленой стене и внезапно обрывающиеся. Откуда они?
То ли это следы прошлых эпох, ушедших навсегда и сохранившихся лишь в памяти
старожилов?

@eng You've managed to wander into a small silent grove in the forest.
For some strange reason most of the forest noises seem to have
disappeared, though you can feel the rustle of the leaves beneath
your feet as you walk. The silence isn't really eerie, however, but
more of a contemplative quietness. Small stones are arranged in an odd
fashion on the ground, much the way seating chairs would be arranged
should the speaker be in the middle of a circle. It's almost as though
a little tribe of beavers just had a river-dam guild meeting and have
left for lunch.
@rus Ты $gn{забрел} в небольшую тихую рощицу. Странно, звуки, веселыми трелями разносив-
шиеся по всему лесу звучат глухо и наконец совсем затихают тут. Все, что ты
слышишь, это шуршание прошлогодней листвы под твоими ногами. Но что еще более
странно, эта почти абсолютная тишина не настораживает, а скорее настраивает на
размышления. Небольшие камни выложены в форме круга, как будто кресла вокруг
оратора. Как будто тут было бурное собрание, и вдруг все ушли...

while the forest streches on to the north and to the west. A fallen
log lies here, softing morning due and rain spray clinging to it's
sparkling bark. No rotting scent seems to come from it as most

@rus Ты идешь по южной границе Изумрудного леса. Отвесный склон горы не дает идти
дальше на юг или восток. Изумрудный лес весело шелестит листвой на севере и

странно, не чувствуется запах гнили. Что это - магия эльфов?

@eng The trail leading south from here starts sloping downward into a
richer wood area. The undisturbed nature of the flora suggests that
this is a rarely travelled part of the forest even by it's own
standards. A small mouse-deer runs across the trail, followed by
a lazy looking lynx. To the north you can just make out a clearing
through the trees, and there seems to be movement.
@rus Тропинка, идущая на юг отсюда, понемногу набирает уклон. Первозданная расти-
тельность заполняет это место, по которому редко ступает нога человека. Малень-
кая полевка не торопясь, бежит по тропинке, за ней обманчиво ленивой походкой
неслышно крадется рысь. На север виден просвет, похоже, что там есть поляна. Ты

@eng Standing here at the south-west end of the Brownie-Pixie Bonanza
Festival, your senses are quickly overloaded with sight, sound
and smell. Brownies clad in soft brown cloth with little feathered
hats mingle happily with their slightly smaller and greener cousins,
the forest pixies. An almost musical chitter-chatter fills the
air, while the aroma of freshly baked treats drift in from the
north. There seems to be a forest dweller's competition, what
with the many games the pixies and brownies seem to be playing. A tug
of war is currently in progress, with the heaving Brownies having
a slight lead over the grunting Pixies.
@rus Ты стоишь на краю поля, на котором проходит Великий Фестиваль.
Твои органы чувств с трудом могут охватить все это многообразие
звуков, запахов, зрелищ. Брауни, одетые в коричневые костюмы и
шляпки с перьями носятся по поляне, перемешиваясь со своими
родичами, пикси, которые одеты в зеленое. Мелодичный смех звучит
на поляне, аромат свежей выпечки достигает твоего обоняния.
Брауни и пикси уже проводят различные соревнования и игры.

shouts of festivity coming from the north  where the Brownie-Pixie

Myrtle tree, under the shade of which some revellers have taken to
rest.  A lone thrush sighs from a branch of the tree.  To the west

@eng You are standing at the south-east end of the Brownie-Pixie Bonanza
Festival. A major element of the celebration involves the grand
feasting of the Great Pie of Friendship. A great huge pumpkin pie
the size of farmer's cart stands proudly on a stone table with a white
tablecloth amidst a bodyguard regiment of apples, peaches, raspberries
and cookies. The dozens of eager eaters seem a bit impatient,
apparently this year's Bonanza Chairman (or Grand Pooh-ba) hasn't
opened the ceremony yet.
@rus Ты стоишь рядом с праздничным столом. Традиционный элемент
праздника - это поедание огромного Пирога Дружбы. Этот тыквенный
пирог размером с телегу гордо стоит на каменном столе, застеленном
белой скатертью. Его окружают блюда с яблоками, персиками, малиной,
булочками и многими другими яствами. Нетерпеливые едоки переминаются
рядом со столом, облизываясь и ожидая, когда председатель Фестиваля
(или Великий Пу-Ба) объявит церемонию поедания открытой.

@eng South-easterly end of the forest@rus У края леса~
@eng You stand at the southern most end of the Emerald Forest. The path
continues on north, while to the west appears to be a large clearing
with sounds of laughter and conversation drifting in with the breeze.
There is a sheer drop to the south, while moutains stretch on as far
as your eyes can see. The terrain belows seems mostly rock and stone
and has spare vegetation. You can just make out a small path heading
roughly to the east through a cluster of bushes and trees.
@rus Ты стоишь у юго-восточного края Изумрудного леса. Тропа уходит в лес
на север, а с запада ветер приносит звука смеха и веселья. Отвесный
обрыв преграждает тебе путь на юг, и насколько видит глаз, там нет
ничего кроме гор. Внизу, в ущелье, ты видишь голую каменистую землю,
с редкими кустиками, оживляющими этот мрачный пейзаж. Едва заметная
тропа уходит на восток через заросли кустов.

@eng Within a garden@rus В саду~
@eng You've managed to stumble into an oriental home. A small wooden hut
sits to the south of a garden lovingly nurtured with blooming yellow,
white and red flower blossoms. Two stone lions sit on wooden pillars
guarding entrance to the garden, while two jade dragons guard the door
to the hut proper. A small bucket pulled well stands next to a pen of
chickens and ducks who cluck and quack away merrily. Carrots, cabbages
and rice are grown in a medium sized plot of land to the north. There
is a small rock pool to the east.
@rus Ты $gn{попал} в какой-то китайский домик. Небольшая деревянная хижина
стоит на южной окраине садика, в котором цветут ухоженные цветы
самых разных видов. Два каменных льва охраняют вход, а два выточен-
ных из нефрита дракона караулят вход в хижину. Небольшая корзина
стоит рядом с загоном для кур и уток. Морковь, кабачки и рис растут
на небольшом поле к северу. Небольшой каменный водоем расположен на
востоке.

@eng A peaceful rock pool@rus У каменного водоема~
@eng You've entered a very peaceful part of the mystic's home. A crystal clear
pool sits here with large smooth pebbles neatly arranged all around it's
circumference. Peering into the pool, the unmoving mirror like surface of
the water reflect your image. There is no way of knowing exactly how deep
the pool is, but it must be very deep since you can't see the bottom. There
is a small wooden bench here beckoning you to sit and rest for a while,
and ponder things you've put aside, and think on matters you've forgotten.
@rus Ты $gn{попал} в очень мирный и спокойный уголок. Водоем с кристально
чистой водой заботливо выложен по краю большими гладкими камнями.
Неподвижная вода отражает тебя не хуже самого лучшего зеркала. Этот
водоем, наверно, очень глубок; даже приглядевшись, ты не видишь дна.
Уютная деревянная скамейка приглашает присесть отдохнуть, подумать
о свершенном и вспомнить о забытом.

@eng Yun Fei Yang's humble abode@rus Скромное жилище Юн Фей Янга~
@eng You stand in the living room of a small wooden hut. A small partioned
kitchen is to the south of here. The spartan furniture, tidiness and
simple basic furniture hint at the occupier's character. There is a
beautiful painting of a young oriental women dressed in long flowing
silk on one of the walls. Parchments with foreign exotic wordings in
flowing black ink script sit on a desk. A small book catches your eye,
it's title being "Zhuge Liang's Chinese-Theran Dictionary". Some of
the scrolls here are written in a language you can understand.
@rus Ты стоишь в маленькой хижине. Небольшая кухня отгорожена в южном
углу дома. Спартанская обстановка, чистота и порядок позволяют угадать
характер жителя этой хижины. На стене висит изображение юной восточной
девушки, одетой в длинное шелковое платье. Манускрипты со странными
знаками, написанными черной тушью, лежат на столе. Маленькая книжка
привлекла твое внимание, она озаглавлена "Краткое руководство по
переводу с китайского на человеческий. Автор: Жуг Лянг". Как ни странно,
некоторые манускрипты написаны на понятном тебе языке.

@eng The Ruined Monastery@rus Разрушенный монастырь~
@eng Tangled vines of ivy hang down from what remains of the arch-entranced
of this small monastery.  It is ruined beyond repair and seems to have
been abandoned many years ago.  There is a quiet and melancholic silence
in the air.  You notice footprints in the dust that lead west into a
leaf-strewn courtyard and continue into a small chapel.  You notice for
the first time that that area of the monastery seems to have been spared
the dereliction that the rest of the monastery has fallen into.
@rus Спутанные ветви ивы свисают с того, что когда-то было парадным входом
этого небольшого монастыря. Он разрушен так, что никому и в голову не
придет его восстанавливать. Уже много лет тишина царит в разрушенных
стенах заброшенного монастыря. Ты замечаешь следы чьих-то ног, они
ведут в засыпанный листьями дворик и дальше, в небольшую часовенку.
Внезапно ты замечаешь, что часовня - единственная часть монастыря,
сохранившаяся среди всеобщего запустения.

@eng The Chapel of Saint Sebastian@rus Часовня Святого Себастьяна~
@eng You stand within the only standing structure of the once proud Monastery.
Evidently the chapel is looked after for the floors are swept, pews wiped
and the stained-glass windows in good working order. A modest pulpit
made of mahogany with a carved pine cross attached to it faces a few rows
of wooden benches. Probably cared for by questing paladins or clerics
on a pilgrimage, you wonder if any of the faithful might be nearby. To
the west wall you see a hole large enough for you to squeeze through.
@rus Ты стоишь внутри единственной сохранившейся постройки в когда-то могучем
монастыре. За часовней, очевидно, следят: полы вымыты, скамейки вытерты,
витражи блестят чистотой. Скромная кафедра красного дерева с врезанным
сосновым крестом стоит перед несколькими рядами скамей. Вероятно, о 
ней заботятся паладины и клерики. В западной стене ты видишь дыру,
достаточно большую, чтобы ты мог пролезть в нее.

@eng Outside the Wall of the Monastery@rus За стенами монастыря~
@eng You stand in a small clearing outside the west wall of a small
chapel within a monastery. Birdsong fills the air while butterflies
yellow and red flutter about happily. A tall large oak brings shade
further west, but all movement to the north and south is prevented by a
combination of trees and the old stone walls of the monastery. There
is a serenity and a sense of life and peace, hinting that it is often
used by others as a place of worship or contemplation.
@rus Ты стоишь на небольшой поляне за стенами часовни. Весело звучит песня
птиц, бабочки порхают над цветами. Высокий старый дуб простирает свои
ветви, давая приятную прохладу и тень. В этом месте царит спокойствие
и мир, и оно часто используется для молитв и созерцания.

@eng The Dead Moors@rus Мертвые болота~
@eng Everything is black here.  These bleak moorlands are where the witches
plant the bodies of their victims, where the rotted corpses will rise by
moonlight as soulless pumpkin men.  The fetid marsh pools have been the
graves of countless creatures, and the choking stench of death rises
from them.
@rus Все черным-черно. Да, именно в этих мрачных болотах ведьмы закапывают
тела своих жертв, где разложившиеся трупы поднимаются в полнолуние,
становясь бездушными тыквоголовыми людьми. Эти зловонные болота стали
могилой сотням и тысячам созданий, и тяжелый запах смерти витает тут.

the north, while in every other direction the desolate marshes darken
your spirits.  Small creatures are feeding on each other at your feet,
while others are clawing their way to the surface of the mud.  A sudden
wind blows the fog away, and you see a small lake through the tall reeds
to the west.
@rus Кажется, вокруг тебя только чернота. Туман покрывает все вплоть до
края леса, виднеющегося на севере. Во всех остальных направлениях
мертвые, тихие болота простираются, кажется, до горизонта. Какие-то

мгновенье уносит туман, и ты видишь небольшое озеро за зарослями 
тростника на западе.

@eng The Witch Wood@rus Ведьмин лес~
@eng You are in the eerie domain of the Weird Sisters.  Ghost lights flicker
palely about your feet and cast a shadowed eye on a variety of rotting
plants and animals that cover the forest floor.  The twisted thorn trees
groan at your approach, and you are aware of a slow hissing that seems
to taunt you from the cover of darkness.  To the south a fog rolls out
onto a dead marsh.
@rus Ты $gn{попал} в мрачные владения трех сестер-ведьм. Призрачные огоньки
бледно мерцают на земле. Странные пугающие тени пляшут на растениях

ты проходишь мимо них, а от шипения, доносящегося из темноты, кровь
стынет в жилах. Куда ни глянь - этот ужасный лес кажется бесконечным.

way beneath your feet.  The end of the jetty, which has long since
collapsed, stands over a dark still lake.  You look over the deep black
waters and see lights on the shore of an island hidden in the mists.
@rus Ты стоишь на полуразрушенном пирсе, чувствуя, как гнилые бревна качаются
у тебя под ногами. Уходящий в озеро конец пирса давно обрушился в иссиня-
черные воды этого угрожающе тихого озера. Оторвав взгляд от водной глади,
ты видишь огни на берегу острова, скрытого туманом.

floors and timbered walls gleam in the soft light of several small oil lamps,
polished and waxed. Small ornaments of various shapes and sizes hang on the
walls and bright tapestries drape the rough wooden furniture and curtained
glass windows. Odd pieces of silver and crystal are sitting upon a long
trestled table in the middle of the room.. Flowers from the forest, all cut
and arranged blossom from various vases and clay pots. The whole cottage
looks bright and cheerful even with nightfall. Obviously, someone with

разбросаны в беспорядке по столу. Лесные цветы стоят в многочисленных
вазах и горшках. Коттедж выглядит уютным и ярким даже с наступлением

@eng You walk into a much smaller room filled with sculptures instead of small
ornaments: over a hundred of them, lining the walls in holographic niches
as well as scattered around the floor on ornate pedestals. The variety, as
you have come to expect, is astonishing, ranging from human-style chunks of
simple stone and wood to others that were more like tethered living creatures
than works of art. Each is illuminated by a flaming blood candle, giving a
sharp contrast to the darkness around. You can barely make out a huge bed
that lies in the northeast corner of this gloomy room. Several other portals
seem to lead out of this room. You wonder where they may lead to...
@rus Ты $gn{зашел} в маленькую комнату, обставленную скульптурами. Свыше сотни
