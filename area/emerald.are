Dryad~
a dryad~
A dryad peers at you inquisitively from behind her tree.~
With her slim fingers she holds her tree protectively as she looks at
you, her brown eyes full of innocence and curiosity.  As you approach
her she looks startled and disappears into the tree, only to appear on
the other side of it moments later to smile at you shyly.  The dryad
is just slightly taller than 5 feet and has the eternally beautiful
and youthful features of the faerie folk.

Nymph~
a nymph~
A nymph looks coyly at you, then winks mischeviously and dances away.~
Her long hair is wet, as if just splashed with the waters of a crystal
brook or stream.  Her movements are full of grace and wild abandon as
she dances along the forest path.  You hear laughter like the sound of
running water and you cannot be sure if it is her singing or a brook
in the distance.  She calls out to you to join her in her dance.

Pixie~
a pixie~
A small pixie stands here laughing cheerfully.~
A small, knee high little pixie looks really engrossed with the
activities of the Pixie-Brownie Bonanza. Not believed to exist by
most of the normal folk of Thera, he is clad in soft green leathers
and cloth and wears a small cap with a proud rooster feather sticking
out. Not looking at them directly, he seems to be eyeing one of the
brownies.

This brownie seems totally oblivious to your presence, and she seems
quite happy to continue chatting merrily to her friends. Slightly
shorter than pixies, the brownies have a reputation of wit and
cheeriness with a touch of mischief. Like most brownies, she has
pretty elvin features, and is dressed totally in brown. She wears
no cap, her otherwise long hair tied in a pony-tail.

Iachimo the Dour Spriggan hides behind a tree grinning maliciously.~
Iachimo is a spiteful prankster who often annoys the residents of the
Emerald Forest.  He sets fires at the roots of trees, poisons the
streams and bites the pixies and brownies.  He doesn't have a good
bone in his spindly body and the forest would be well rid of him.
He unleashes a torrent of curses at you.

one individual formally known as "The Chairman of the Great Feast

most of the participants. This particular Pooh-Ba seems to have a
bit of halfling blood in him, for he towers almost a head over the
pixies and brownies. He is dressed in large and flowing green-brown
robe, and seems rather busy with his duties.

spared the tricksters or thieves of the larger towns. Her basket is

    The green leaves among
    I heard a wild flower
    Singing a song:
    I slept in the earth
    In the silent night
    I murmur'd my fears
    And I felt delight.
    In the morning I went
    As rosy as morn
    To seek for new Joy
    But I met with scorn"

Marisa~
The Enchantress of Yrn seeks out her ancient nemesis.~
Marisa of Nag'Yrn is the chosen of Yog-Sothoth. She wears a samite
gown of the purest white, her long flame-red hair tied up in an
elaborate top-knot. A wretched look of cruelty crosses her young
face as she contemplates the death of her nemesis, the Bandit King
Imbessar. She has tracked him to the Emerald Forest and it is here
that they will have their last battle.

a lady ranger~
A beautiful lady is talking to some animals here.~
This woman seems (quite impossibly) to be having a conversation with
the animals of the forest! Two blue jays, a squirrel and two rabbits
are chittering and chattering and her smiles, laughter and responding
noises suggest that it is a merry conversation. Possibly elven or
half-elven, she looks about the age of a young human maid of twenty
years, her long blond hair fall gently over her shoulders making
her strikingly beautiful.

A small pixie stands here laughing cheerfully.~
A small, knee high little pixie looks really engrossed with the
activities of the Pixie-Brownie Bonanza. Not believed to exist by
most of the normal folk of Thera, he is clad in soft green leathers
and cloth and wears a small cap with a proud rooster feather sticking
out. Not looking at them directly, he seems to be eyeing one of the
brownies.

for a dance.  A tango perhaps, or a foxtrot.

There is a fiendish donkey munching on marshweeds here.~
The fiendish donkey looks sallow-skinned and mean-spirited. Most of
them eventually end up roasted, toasted or flambed on some demon lord's
banquet table.  This one looks set to give you a good kick if you won't
let it continue eating its weeds.  It bares large yellowed teeth at you.

 "O me! what eyes hath Love put in my head,
  Which have no correspondence with true sight;
  Or, if they have, where is my judgement fled,
  That censures falsely what they see aright?
  If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
  What means the world to say it is not so?
  if it be not, then love doth well denote
  Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no.
  How can it?  O! how can Love's eye be true,
  That is so vex'd with watching and with tears?
  No marvel then, though I mistake my view;
  The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.
  O cunning love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,
  Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find."

You feel like throwing it away.

skin cloak  ~
@eng An elven princess of a past age gave up her skin to the witches of the
Lochhearn to save her people, and they made this awful artifact from
her sacrifice.  The coven at Struith is now destroyed, but this example
of their evil and blasphemy has been saved by the Last Sisters.  It
retains a flawless and immortal beauty that is horrible to behold.

@eng A Fog-Shrouded Trail@rus   ~
@eng You are on a fog-shrouded trail which runs up the side of this dark
mountain.  The ground is wet and muddy with melted snow, and the path
which should lead to the Miden'nir disappears amongst the mist and the
trees.  There is nothing for you to do but follow the trail that twists
up towards the broken, snow-covered heights of the mountain range.
An old stone tablet with inscriptions stands beside a bush in the
corner.

@eng The Haunted Pine Forest@rus  ~
@eng The snow begins to fall thickly as you enter a pine forest in the
mountains.  The burnt remains of two log cabins lie in a clearing
about a dozen yards off the path.  There is a disconcerting silence
in these woods, an oppressive lifelessness that makes you want to
leave them immediately.  The trail stretches through these haunted
woods up the side of the mountain and down through the fog to the
foothills of the range.

to the Vale of Clover, a small valley at the foot of the mountains.
Looking down the road, you see a small village nestled beside a bend
in the stream.  Tall heather blows in the wind and you see some cows
grazing idly nearby.  The road east runs down into a wooded dell.

accompanied by girlish titters, you deduce it also where the local lasses
receive the attentions of their suitors.  Scattered trees and trimmed
hedges provide the green with shadynooks and pivate arbors.  The
hillock continues north, while the path west will take you back to the

trees.  Though empty now, it seems a likely spot for young couples to
exchange professions of love, undisturbed by friends or irate parents.
Having no time for such adolescent frivolities, you quickly scan the
countryside and note that from this vantage point, you can look over the
entire village of Clover.  You espy a dirt track which leads west from
the village and then turns north to a ruined abbey.

@eng An Old Dirt Track@rus  ~
@eng You are on an old dirt track outside the village of Clover.  The path
seems little travelled, and wildflowers grow abundantly by the side of
the track.  Heading east, you will return to the village.  The dirt track
continues north for some miles.

@eng Farmer Griff' Farm@rus  ~
@eng You stand in front of a gaily-painted barnhouse.  Old Griff - farmer,
freeman and entrepreneur - seems to be having a little trouble keeping
his livestock in order.  His chickens are harrying his ducks in the
duck pond, while a big brown shaggy dog is chasing his pigs around the
entire farm.  From inside a blue and yellow farmhouse you hear Princess
Yaruga, the farmer's wife, shouting angrily in a foreign tongue.

@eng The trees seem to hang back in fear as you walk into a wide clearing in
the witch wood.  The clearing is dominated by a broken stone altar that
is caked red and black and the blood and grime of centuries of evil.
The torches that hang from the boles of the trees ringing the clearing
throw a halflight on a deep hole in the altar.

a path that leads west into the mists.  The forest lies to your east and

@eng The Entrance of the Witch Wood@rus     ~
@eng Your uneasiness mounts as you walk along this haunted stretch of road.
The mist clears, and you find yourself in a nightmarish forest.  The
empty husk of a dead nymph lies at your feet, and on either side of you,
the trees look twisted and tortured into unnatural shapes.  The depths
of the forest sends up a hopeless cry to usher you into the woods that
ring the edge of Hell.

@eng Under Dark Woods@rus    ~
@eng The path continues darkly under rows of Elder trees.  A crooked road
leads west through a tangled hedge of briars.  A mist prevents you from
looking beyond the hedge, but you sense a powerful and oppressive evil
reaching out towards you with cold and clawed fingers.  To the south,
the forest seems to lighten considerably, and you are about to leave
in that direction when a tattered parchment, flapping weakly in the
wind, falls at your feet.

@eng (Parchment: It is yellowed and seems savagely ripped from a tome.
 "... I mouthed a prayer for my fallen brother Alandro as I raised his
  morning-star to smite the foul witch who had struck him down.  But I
  had reckoned without her Sisters, and the twain now flew shrieking
  towards me.  The first, diabolically transformed, pinioned me to the
  ground, while her corrupt breath drove the sight from my eyes and
  caused boils to burst from my skin.  The other, whom I had seen to be
  beautiful but terrible even as I was made blind, wrested my weapon
  from me and tore at my face.  I know not how I fled from their cursed
  abode, but the relief I felt then at my escape was vainly felt, for
  even now, I nightly suffer the torments of their evil blandishments.
  In my sleep I see myself being chased at the edge of a black abyss by
  the Devil's huntsmen and their hellhounds slavering for my soul.  I
  wake up drained, I feel both my faith and my sanity slipping from me.

  We had been foolishly proud, thinking we could destroy those servants
  of evil alone.  Now we are undone, and the relic of our Holy Saint is
  lost forever.")

@eng In the Emerald Forest@rus   ~
@eng A circle of blue-capped mushrooms form an old faerie ring by the side
of the path you are on.  On certain nights of the year, the faerie folk
wander out into such rings for wild dances by the moonlight.  It is
said that mortals who are drawn into the dancing circle on such nights
can be held captive by faerie food or a faerie's kiss and made to dance
on and on for a period of seven years.  You hear a titter of laughter
from the branches of a tree, but when you look up you see nothing.

@eng Before the Great Tree@rus   ~
@eng You stand at the perimeter of the largest, most incredible tree that
you have ever laid eyes on.  It has gold-flecked leaves that are the
size of small horses, with thick roots supporting a massive trunk that
is easily twice the size of the grand fortress of the Templar Knights
of Renhorden.  It seems to stretch endlessly into the sky, and you
wonder why you did not see it towering above all the other trees in
the forest.  You long to inch closer, but cannot seem to move beyond
an invisible barrier that keeps you about a hundred yards away.  You
see movement and lights in and about the tree, but there seems to be
no way you can get closer to it.

@eng The Lost Grotto@rus  ~
@eng You follow the stream to a limpid pool where the waters lap gently
against the rocks.  Large ferns provide shade from above and the petals
of brightly-colored flowers float in the pool.  Sitting on the moss-
covered rocks by the pool is a slim young girl dressed in green.  She
has long black hair and elfin features, a yew bow slung across her back.
She seems oblivious to your presence and hums softly as she passes her
hand through the waters.

@eng By a Stream@rus  ~
@eng You stand by a wide stream that flows swiftly to the north.  Drawn by
the sudden sound of musical laughter, you look over the tops of some
lilac bushes and spy a group of nymphs frolicking in the stream.  It
seems like a vision captured from some nature god's idyllic dream.  You
hear the distant roar of a waterfall to your south.

@eng The Waterfall Glade@rus ~
@eng A majestic waterfall pours from high above the mountains to the south.
Great torrents of water crash down on the rocks in a wide pool, and even
where you stand in a shaded glade, the wind blows sprays of water into
your face.  A profusion of flowering shrubs grow at the edge of the
pool.  In a large shaded retreat made by the overhanging branches of
silver oak trees stands a likeness of Altariel, the Lady of the Woods.
At the base of the waterfall, a rock pool with crystal clear water has
formed.

the smallest of windows built into the mound.  It appears this is a
faerie hill, from which the faerie Rades ride out in celebration
through the wood paths of the Emerald Forest.  The angry face of a
faerie suddenly stares out at you from the window and interrupts your
scrutiny with a string of curses.

@eng In this small lonely clearing is an ancient stump.  Many years ago, a
forester callously hewed down a tree here.  In retribution, Altariel,
whose sanctuary the Emerald Forest is, transformed him into a poplar
tree.  The poplar tree stands here beside the stump, its branches cut
by the rangers of the forest whenever they are in need of wood.

notice a faint outline of a bridge resting in the shade of the long
leafy branches of the tall, flanking trees.

It's origin is a mystery, but the fine detail and craftsmanship it bears
would rival even the most cunning of woodsmiths.  The branches of the
tall trees that grow on the banks of the stream cover the bridge in a
soft cool embrace while a breeze flows in from the north.  Huge salmon
and rainbow trout weave their way amongst the rocks in the stream below.
To the west the forest stretches on, while the sounds of laughter and
play drift in softly from the south.

@eng The Shady bridge@rus  ~
@eng You stand on the eastern end of a finely crafted wooden bridge. It's
edges have small engraved runes carved into them, and the wood
is probably a form of pine or oak from the Emerald Forest itself.
Lacking the dull weathered tone and creaking of most wooden
bridges, it spans across a fairly wide river flowing in a north-south
direction. The height of the surrounding trees provide a pleasant
shade from the noon-day sun.

intently you see a blurred outline of a small wooden bridge in the
distance. Who built that bridge? And why? Only a few seasoned rangers
have ever come this deep into the enchanted wood, and none ever
mentioned the existence of construction of a bridge. As far as you
know, the forest has resisted gently but firmly all attempts at
colonisation or lumbering, which makes it quite a curiousity.

remain silent, at least to your ears while the aroma of fresh woodland

@eng This is a small platform with four walls and a leaf roof rather than
a proper tree house.  Nevertheless, it is very cosy and could accomodate
two quite comfortably.  A pot of jasmine tea is simmering over a fire
and a few plush cushions are scattered on a rug in one corner.  On a
shelf on the west wall are the complete works of Shakespeare, while
another book lies half-read on the floor.

@eng A Small Clearing@rus  ~
@eng You stand in a small clearing deep in the Emerald Forest. The ground
shows no evidence of trees being cut down or any other indication
that the clearing is carved from axe or hand, yet the borders seem too
neat to be the result of Mother Nature's whim. In some areas the
shrubs and bushes appear to have gone out of their way (if that is
possible) to align themselves, and the soft wood grass while not having
the blunt heads of a kept garden seem to be growing neatly in line all
by themselves. Strong magic is at work here.

@eng The Ragged Trail@rus  ~
@eng You stand on a ragged forest trail with passage leading in all four
directions. The pathways to the north, south and east lead deeper
into the woods, while a winding trail west seems to end in a small
clearing. From where you stand you can see small movement and
curious sound which you can't quite make out. The tree branches
sway softly while you decide your next course.

@eng The Honey Bun@rus ~
@eng Two lines of pixies and brownies stand facing one another yelling
and hooting in excitement. They seem to be deep in a game of
'Pixie, Brownie and Honey Bun'. A small bag filled with pipeweed
seed is placed squarely in the middle of the line, while both teams
are numbered off. A number is called, and the respective brownie
or pixie has to run forward, grab the bag and return to the line
without being touched. Looks like great fun.

@eng A fairly large clearing@rus   ~
@eng There is an incredible sight before you! Dozens and dozens of
green clad pixies and oak brown dressed brownies are milling
around in a fairly large clearing, which stretches on to the east and
south. Little temporary stalls have been set up, selling a wide
variety of enchanting desserts, cream puffs and wonderful potions.
The grand Pixie-Brownie Bonanza Festival seems up in force, and
there are no signs of it ending in the near future...

@eng The three way woodland@rus   ~
@eng You stand at the middling spot of a three way woodland trail deep
in the Emerald Forest. There are clear passages to the north, west
and east, while the path to the south abruptly ends at the foot of a
sheer cliff face, with a wall so smooth that it would be impossible
to climb. A variety of bird song and animal sound fill the air.

@eng A Forest Trail@rus  ~
@eng The somewhat ragged west-ward forest trail makes a sharp right and
southernly turn here, making further travel to the west difficult
if not impossible, would be safer to backtrack and find another
path instead of hacking through the notoriously resilient trees of the
Emerald Forest. A tall tree with huge leafy branches branches stands
here tempting you to take a break and rest in it's shade.

@eng A Dwindling Forest Path@rus  ~
@eng The forest path begins to dwindle here.  It's obvious you've entered
a part of the forest seldom visited by anyone.  You notice the richness
of the flora here, with a wider and thicker range of herbs growing in
wild abandon across the ground or in small cul-de-sacs formed at the
roots of the oak trees.  You hear a rustle in the bushes, but staring
intently without trying to look too obvious, you notice nothing.

@eng A Lovely Trail@rus ~
@eng You are following a faint north-south trail in the Emerald Forest.
Swallows and Bluebirds fill the air with song and laughter, and you
spy a small red-breast Robin sitting motionless on a branch on one of
the oak trees. The serenity of this forest is amazing, you feel at
peace and safe, as though you just stepped into a fairy tale where
the knights kill all the trolls, and nobody stays hungry. It's hard
not to day dream, walking here.

@eng The Tombstone@rus  ~
@eng There is something rather peculiar about this part of the Emerald
Forest. A small tombstone sits in the middle of a small clearing.
Carved from a white substance, it's shiny surface reflects what
little sunlight that manages to escape from the umbrella covering
of trees surrounding the grave. Freshly picked flowers lie at the
foot of the tombstone, while strange symbols are lovingly engraved
on it. The strange thing is there are no paths leading from or to the
area, which would puzzle even the most observant elf or ranger. Who
would pick flowers for a lone grave and leave no evidence of passing?

@eng The Wood-Path@rus  ~
@eng The Wood-path you're following gets more pronounced and used here,
a testimony that the Emerald Forest isn't populated (or at least
explored and travelled) only by it's original furry or buzzing citizens.
Multi-coloured flowers dance gaily in the wind while clinging to the feet
of the tall oak and pine trees flanking the forest road. Flying
squirrels leap from branch to branch, probably searching for a
delicious cashew or two.

@eng Woodkeeper's Clearing@rus  ~
@eng The path ends in a medium sized clearing. A small wooden sign states
quite dogmatically "WoodKeeper's Clearing. Forest haters not welcomed.
Orcs, Bugbears and Goblins keep out!". A number of elves and humans
dressed in a mixture of green and brown stand around here engaging in
friendly conversation. The actual Keeper's Meet hasn't started yet,
apparently there are rangers from distant woodlands still trying to
make it for the meeting. A pile of scrolls sit on a small table,
probably pamphlets to be distributed to the arriving participants of
the meeting.

@eng Thick green vines form an impossible barrier to the south.. There is
no reason to doubt that these vines possess the same ability to
block even the most determined machete-armed lumber-dwarf then all
the others. What does seem a bit strange, however, are faint footsteps
leading up to the vines and abruptly stopping. Could they merely be
tracks from an age past, now lost to the world and found only in time
and memory?

@eng The Silent Grove@rus  ~
@eng You've managed to wander into a small silent grove in the forest.
For some strange reason most of the forest noises seem to have
disappeared, though you can feel the rustle of the leaves beneath
your feet as you walk. The silence isn't really eerie, however, but
more of a contemplative quietness. Small stones are arranged in an odd
fashion on the ground, much the way seating chairs would be arranged
should the speaker be in the middle of a circle. It's almost as though
a little tribe of beavers just had a river-dam guild meeting and have
left for lunch.

while the forest streches on to the north and to the west. A fallen
log lies here, softing morning due and rain spray clinging to it's
sparkling bark. No rotting scent seems to come from it as most
logs would emit.

@eng The trail leading south from here starts sloping downward into a
richer wood area. The undisturbed nature of the flora suggests that
this is a rarely travelled part of the forest even by it's own
standards. A small mouse-deer runs across the trail, followed by
a lazy looking lynx. To the north you can just make out a clearing
through the trees, and there seems to be movement.

@eng The Bonanza@rus ~
@eng Standing here at the south-west end of the Brownie-Pixie Bonanza
Festival, your senses are quickly overloaded with sight, sound
and smell. Brownies clad in soft brown cloth with little feathered
hats mingle happily with their slightly smaller and greener cousins,
the forest pixies. An almost musical chitter-chatter fills the
air, while the aroma of freshly baked treats drift in from the
north. There seems to be a forest dweller's competition, what
with the many games the pixies and brownies seem to be playing. A tug
of war is currently in progress, with the heaving Brownies having
a slight lead over the grunting Pixies.

shouts of festivity coming from the north  where the Brownie-Pixie
Bonanza is in full swing.  In the centre of the clearing is an old
Myrtle tree, under the shade of which some revellers have taken to
rest.  A lone thrush sighs from a branch of the tree.  To the west

@eng You are standing at the south-east end of the Brownie-Pixie Bonanza
Festival. A major element of the celebration involves the grand
feasting of the Great Pie of Friendship. A great huge pumpkin pie
the size of farmer's cart stands proudly on a stone table with a white
tablecloth amidst a bodyguard regiment of apples, peaches, raspberries
and cookies. The dozens of eager eaters seem a bit impatient,
apparently this year's Bonanza Chairman (or Grand Pooh-ba) hasn't
opened the ceremony yet.

@eng South-easterly end of the forest@rus   ~
@eng You stand at the southern most end of the Emerald Forest. The path
continues on north, while to the west appears to be a large clearing
with sounds of laughter and conversation drifting in with the breeze.
There is a sheer drop to the south, while moutains stretch on as far
as your eyes can see. The terrain belows seems mostly rock and stone
and has spare vegetation. You can just make out a small path heading
roughly to the east through a cluster of bushes and trees.

@eng Within a garden@rus  ~
@eng You've managed to stumble into an oriental home. A small wooden hut
sits to the south of a garden lovingly nurtured with blooming yellow,
white and red flower blossoms. Two stone lions sit on wooden pillars
guarding entrance to the garden, while two jade dragons guard the door
to the hut proper. A small bucket pulled well stands next to a pen of
chickens and ducks who cluck and quack away merrily. Carrots, cabbages
and rice are grown in a medium sized plot of land to the north. There
is a small rock pool to the east.

@eng A peaceful rock pool@rus   ~
@eng You've entered a very peaceful part of the mystic's home. A crystal clear
pool sits here with large smooth pebbles neatly arranged all around it's
circumference. Peering into the pool, the unmoving mirror like surface of
the water reflect your image. There is no way of knowing exactly how deep
the pool is, but it must be very deep since you can't see the bottom. There
is a small wooden bench here beckoning you to sit and rest for a while,
and ponder things you've put aside, and think on matters you've forgotten.

@eng Yun Fei Yang's humble abode@rus     ~
@eng You stand in the living room of a small wooden hut. A small partioned
kitchen is to the south of here. The spartan furniture, tidiness and
simple basic furniture hint at the occupier's character. There is a
beautiful painting of a young oriental women dressed in long flowing
silk on one of the walls. Parchments with foreign exotic wordings in
flowing black ink script sit on a desk. A small book catches your eye,
it's title being "Zhuge Liang's Chinese-Theran Dictionary". Some of
the scrolls here are written in a language you can understand.

@eng The Ruined Monastery@rus  ~
@eng Tangled vines of ivy hang down from what remains of the arch-entranced
of this small monastery.  It is ruined beyond repair and seems to have
been abandoned many years ago.  There is a quiet and melancholic silence
in the air.  You notice footprints in the dust that lead west into a
leaf-strewn courtyard and continue into a small chapel.  You notice for
the first time that that area of the monastery seems to have been spared
the dereliction that the rest of the monastery has fallen into.

@eng The Chapel of Saint Sebastian@rus   ~
@eng You stand within the only standing structure of the once proud Monastery.
Evidently the chapel is looked after for the floors are swept, pews wiped
and the stained-glass windows in good working order. A modest pulpit
made of mahogany with a carved pine cross attached to it faces a few rows
of wooden benches. Probably cared for by questing paladins or clerics
on a pilgrimage, you wonder if any of the faithful might be nearby. To
the west wall you see a hole large enough for you to squeeze through.

@eng Outside the Wall of the Monastery@rus   ~
@eng You stand in a small clearing outside the west wall of a small
chapel within a monastery. Birdsong fills the air while butterflies
yellow and red flutter about happily. A tall large oak brings shade
further west, but all movement to the north and south is prevented by a
combination of trees and the old stone walls of the monastery. There
is a serenity and a sense of life and peace, hinting that it is often
used by others as a place of worship or contemplation.

@eng The Dead Moors@rus  ~
@eng Everything is black here.  These bleak moorlands are where the witches
plant the bodies of their victims, where the rotted corpses will rise by
moonlight as soulless pumpkin men.  The fetid marsh pools have been the
graves of countless creatures, and the choking stench of death rises
from them.

@eng Everything is black here.  The fogs rolls into the edge of the woods to
the north, while in every other direction the desolate marshes darken
your spirits.  Small creatures are feeding on each other at your feet,
while others are clawing their way to the surface of the mud.  A sudden
wind blows the fog away, and you see a small lake through the tall reeds
to the west.

@eng The Witch Wood@rus  ~
@eng You are in the eerie domain of the Weird Sisters.  Ghost lights flicker
palely about your feet and cast a shadowed eye on a variety of rotting
plants and animals that cover the forest floor.  The twisted thorn trees
groan at your approach, and you are aware of a slow hissing that seems
to taunt you from the cover of darkness.  To the south a fog rolls out
onto a dead marsh.

way beneath your feet.  The end of the jetty, which has long since
collapsed, stands over a dark still lake.  You look over the deep black
waters and see lights on the shore of an island hidden in the mists.

@eng You are inside a neat and spotlessly clean cottage. The sanded wood plank
floors and timbered walls gleam in the soft light of several small oil lamps,
polished and waxed. Small ornaments of various shapes and sizes hang on the
walls and bright tapestries drape the rough wooden furniture and curtained
glass windows. Odd pieces of silver and crystal are sitting upon a long
trestled table in the middle of the room.. Flowers from the forest, all cut
and arranged blossom from various vases and clay pots. The whole cottage
looks bright and cheerful even with nightfall. Obviously, someone with
good tastes lives here!

@eng Redbaron's Bedroom@rus   ~
@eng You walk into a much smaller room filled with sculptures instead of small
ornaments: over a hundred of them, lining the walls in holographic niches
as well as scattered around the floor on ornate pedestals. The variety, as
you have come to expect, is astonishing, ranging from human-style chunks of
simple stone and wood to others that were more like tethered living creatures
than works of art. Each is illuminated by a flaming blood candle, giving a
sharp contrast to the darkness around. You can barely make out a huge bed
that lies in the northeast corner of this gloomy room. Several other portals
seem to lead out of this room. You wonder where they may lead to...
