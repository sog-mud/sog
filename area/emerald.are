Dryad~
a dryad~
A dryad peers at you inquisitively from behind her tree.
~
With her slim fingers she holds her tree protectively as she looks at
you, her brown eyes full of innocence and curiosity.  As you approach
her she looks startled and disappears into the tree, only to appear on
the other side of it moments later to smile at you shyly.  The dryad
is just slightly taller than 5 feet and has the eternally beautiful
and youthful features of the faerie folk.

Nymph~
a nymph~
A nymph looks coyly at you, then winks mischeviously and dances away.
~
Her long hair is wet, as if just splashed with the waters of a crystal
brook or stream.  Her movements are full of grace and wild abandon as
she dances along the forest path.  You hear laughter like the sound of
running water and you cannot be sure if it is her singing or a brook
in the distance.  She calls out to you to join her in her dance.

A small, knee high little pixie looks really engrossed with the
activities of the Pixie-Brownie Bonanza. Not believed to exist by
most of the normal folk of Thera, he is clad in soft green leathers
and cloth and wears a small cap with a proud rooster feather sticking
out. Not looking at them directly, he seems to be eyeing one of the
brownies.

This brownie seems totally oblivious to your presence, and she seems
quite happy to continue chatting merrily to her friends. Slightly
shorter than pixies, the brownies have a reputation of wit and
cheeriness with a touch of mischief. Like most brownies, she has
pretty elvin features, and is dressed totally in brown. She wears
no cap, her otherwise long hair tied in a pony-tail.

~
Iachimo is a spiteful prankster who often annoys the residents of the
Emerald Forest.  He sets fires at the roots of trees, poisons the
streams and bites the pixies and brownies.  He doesn't have a good
bone in his spindly body and the forest would be well rid of him.
He unleashes a torrent of curses at you.

There is a cheerful brownie here chatting merrily away.

This brownie seems totally oblivious to your presence, and she seems
quite happy to continue chatting merrily to her friends. Slightly
shorter than pixies, the brownies have a reputation of wit and
cheeriness with a touch of mischief. Like most brownies, she has
pretty elvin features, and is dressed totally in brown. She wears
no cap, her otherwise long hair tied in a pony-tail.

 "O me! what eyes hath Love put in my head,
  Which have no correspondence with true sight;
  Or, if they have, where is my judgement fled,
  That censures falsely what they see aright?
  If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
  What means the world to say it is not so?
  if it be not, then love doth well denote
  Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no.
  How can it?  O! how can Love's eye be true,
  That is so vex'd with watching and with tears?
  No marvel then, though I mistake my view;
  The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.
  O cunning love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,
  Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find."

@eng You are on a fog-shrouded trail which runs up the side of this dark
mountain.  The ground is wet and muddy with melted snow, and the path
which should lead to the Miden'nir disappears amongst the mist and the
trees.  There is nothing for you to do but follow the trail that twists
up towards the broken, snow-covered heights of the mountain range.
An old stone tablet with inscriptions stands beside a bush in the

mountains.  The burnt remains of two log cabins lie in a clearing
about a dozen yards off the path.  There is a disconcerting silence
in these woods, an oppressive lifelessness that makes you want to
leave them immediately.  The trail stretches through these haunted
woods up the side of the mountain and down through the fog to the
foothills of the range.

to the Vale of Clover, a small valley at the foot of the mountains.

@eng In Clover@rus  ~
@eng It's quite beautiful here in the quiet village of Clover.  The air is
fresh and filled with the scent of flowers.  There are some quaintly-
appointed cottages painted in bright colors on either side of the road.
You hear ringing laughter to the east, where a country path winds up a
hillock.  The village square lies to the north.

@eng A Green Hillock@rus  ~
@eng You are on a small meadow on the hillock.  This seems to be where the
folk of Clover have their picnics.  From the sound of manly crooning
accompanied by girlish titters, you deduce it also where the local lasses
receive the attentions of their suitors.  Scattered trees and trimmed
hedges provide the green with shadynooks and pivate arbors.  The
hillock continues north, while the path west will take you back to the
village.

@eng A Secluded Corner of the Meadow@rus    ~
@eng You are in a quiet corner of the meadow, well-shaded by two large cypress
trees.  Though empty now, it seems a likely spot for young couples to
exchange professions of love, undisturbed by friends or irate parents.
Having no time for such adolescent frivolities, you quickly scan the
countryside and note that from this vantage point, you can look over the
entire village of Clover.  You espy a dirt track which leads west from
the village and then turns north to a ruined abbey.

where you are standing.  A gaggle of goodwives are gossiping by the
village well while their children are chasing a playful dog.  An apple
tree lends its shade to two old men who are sharing a large tankard of
cider.  You see a large farm to the north and a beaten dirt track to
the west.

freeman and entrepreneur - seems to be having a little trouble keeping
his livestock in order.  His chickens are harrying his ducks in the
duck pond, while a big brown shaggy dog is chasing his pigs around the
entire farm.  From inside a blue and yellow farmhouse you hear Princess
Yaruga, the farmer's wife, shouting angrily in a foreign tongue.

the witch wood.  The clearing is dominated by a broken stone altar that
is caked red and black and the blood and grime of centuries of evil.
The torches that hang from the boles of the trees ringing the clearing
throw a halflight on a deep hole in the altar.

@eng Your uneasiness mounts as you walk along this haunted stretch of road.
The mist clears, and you find yourself in a nightmarish forest.  The
empty husk of a dead nymph lies at your feet, and on either side of you,
the trees look twisted and tortured into unnatural shapes.  The depths
of the forest sends up a hopeless cry to usher you into the woods that
ring the edge of Hell.

@eng The path continues darkly under rows of Elder trees.  A crooked road
leads west through a tangled hedge of briars.  A mist prevents you from
looking beyond the hedge, but you sense a powerful and oppressive evil
reaching out towards you with cold and clawed fingers.  To the south,
the forest seems to lighten considerably, and you are about to leave
in that direction when a tattered parchment, flapping weakly in the
wind, falls at your feet.

 "... I mouthed a prayer for my fallen brother Alandro as I raised his
  morning-star to smite the foul witch who had struck him down.  But I
  had reckoned without her Sisters, and the twain now flew shrieking
  towards me.  The first, diabolically transformed, pinioned me to the
  ground, while her corrupt breath drove the sight from my eyes and
  caused boils to burst from my skin.  The other, whom I had seen to be
  beautiful but terrible even as I was made blind, wrested my weapon
  from me and tore at my face.  I know not how I fled from their cursed
  abode, but the relief I felt then at my escape was vainly felt, for
  even now, I nightly suffer the torments of their evil blandishments.
  In my sleep I see myself being chased at the edge of a black abyss by
  the Devil's huntsmen and their hellhounds slavering for my soul.  I
  wake up drained, I feel both my faith and my sanity slipping from me.

  We had been foolishly proud, thinking we could destroy those servants
  of evil alone.  Now we are undone, and the relic of our Holy Saint is
  lost forever.")

A circle of blue-capped mushrooms form an old faerie ring by the side
of the path you are on.  On certain nights of the year, the faerie folk
wander out into such rings for wild dances by the moonlight.  It is
said that mortals who are drawn into the dancing circle on such nights
can be held captive by faerie food or a faerie's kiss and made to dance
on and on for a period of seven years.  You hear a titter of laughter
from the branches of a tree, but when you look up you see nothing.

You stand at the perimeter of the largest, most incredible tree that
you have ever laid eyes on.  It has gold-flecked leaves that are the
size of small horses, with thick roots supporting a massive trunk that
is easily twice the size of the grand fortress of the Templar Knights
of Renhorden.  It seems to stretch endlessly into the sky, and you
wonder why you did not see it towering above all the other trees in
the forest.  You long to inch closer, but cannot seem to move beyond
an invisible barrier that keeps you about a hundred yards away.  You
see movement and lights in and about the tree, but there seems to be
no way you can get closer to it.

The Lost Grotto~
You follow the stream to a limpid pool where the waters lap gently
against the rocks.  Large ferns provide shade from above and the petals
of brightly-colored flowers float in the pool.  Sitting on the moss-
covered rocks by the pool is a slim young girl dressed in green.  She
has long black hair and elfin features, a yew bow slung across her back.
She seems oblivious to your presence and hums softly as she passes her
hand through the waters.

By a Stream~
You stand by a wide stream that flows swiftly to the north.  Drawn by
the sudden sound of musical laughter, you look over the tops of some
lilac bushes and spy a group of nymphs frolicking in the stream.  It
seems like a vision captured from some nature god's idyllic dream.  You
hear the distant roar of a waterfall to your south.

The Waterfall Glade~
A majestic waterfall pours from high above the mountains to the south.
Great torrents of water crash down on the rocks in a wide pool, and even
where you stand in a shaded glade, the wind blows sprays of water into
your face.  A profusion of flowering shrubs grow at the edge of the
pool.  In a large shaded retreat made by the overhanging branches of
silver oak trees stands a likeness of Altariel, the Lady of the Woods.
At the base of the waterfall, a rock pool with crystal clear water has
formed.

The path here runs around a low grassy mound.  Looking closer, you see

through the wood paths of the Emerald Forest.  The angry face of a
faerie suddenly stares out at you from the window and interrupts your
scrutiny with a string of curses.

whose sanctuary the Emerald Forest is, transformed him into a poplar
tree.  The poplar tree stands here beside the stump, its branches cut
by the rangers of the forest whenever they are in need of wood.

You stand on the western end of a wooden bridge in the Emerald Forest.
It's origin is a mystery, but the fine detail and craftsmanship it bears
would rival even the most cunning of woodsmiths.  The branches of the
tall trees that grow on the banks of the stream cover the bridge in a
soft cool embrace while a breeze flows in from the north.  Huge salmon
and rainbow trout weave their way amongst the rocks in the stream below.
To the west the forest stretches on, while the sounds of laughter and
play drift in softly from the south.

You stand on the eastern end of a finely crafted wooden bridge. It's
edges have small engraved runes carved into them, and the wood
is probably a form of pine or oak from the Emerald Forest itself.
Lacking the dull weathered tone and creaking of most wooden
bridges, it spans across a fairly wide river flowing in a north-south
direction. The height of the surrounding trees provide a pleasant
shade from the noon-day sun.

have ever come this deep into the enchanted wood, and none ever
mentioned the existence of construction of a bridge. As far as you
know, the forest has resisted gently but firmly all attempts at
colonisation or lumbering, which makes it quite a curiousity.

@eng There is something rather peculiar about this part of the Emerald
Forest. A small tombstone sits in the middle of a small clearing.
Carved from a white substance, it's shiny surface reflects what
little sunlight that manages to escape from the umbrella covering
of trees surrounding the grave. Freshly picked flowers lie at the
foot of the tombstone, while strange symbols are lovingly engraved
on it. The strange thing is there are no paths leading from or to the
area, which would puzzle even the most observant elf or ranger. Who
would pick flowers for a lone grave and leave no evidence of passing?

@eng The Wood-Path@rus  ~
@eng The Wood-path you're following gets more pronounced and used here,
a testimony that the Emerald Forest isn't populated (or at least
explored and travelled) only by it's original furry or buzzing citizens.
Multi-coloured flowers dance gaily in the wind while clinging to the feet
of the tall oak and pine trees flanking the forest road. Flying
squirrels leap from branch to branch, probably searching for a
delicious cashew or two.

Woodkeeper's Clearing~
The path ends in a medium sized clearing. A small wooden sign states
quite dogmatically "WoodKeeper's Clearing. Forest haters not welcomed.
Orcs, Bugbears and Goblins keep out!". A number of elves and humans
dressed in a mixture of green and brown stand around here engaging in
friendly conversation. The actual Keeper's Meet hasn't started yet,
apparently there are rangers from distant woodlands still trying to
make it for the meeting. A pile of scrolls sit on a small table,
probably pamphlets to be distributed to the arriving participants of
the meeting.

The Green Vines~
Thick green vines form an impossible barrier to the south.. There is
no reason to doubt that these vines possess the same ability to
block even the most determined machete-armed lumber-dwarf then all
the others. What does seem a bit strange, however, are faint footsteps
leading up to the vines and abruptly stopping. Could they merely be
tracks from an age past, now lost to the world and found only in time
and memory?

The Silent Grove~
You've managed to wander into a small silent grove in the forest.
For some strange reason most of the forest noises seem to have
disappeared, though you can feel the rustle of the leaves beneath
your feet as you walk. The silence isn't really eerie, however, but
more of a contemplative quietness. Small stones are arranged in an odd
fashion on the ground, much the way seating chairs would be arranged
should the speaker be in the middle of a circle. It's almost as though
a little tribe of beavers just had a river-dam guild meeting and have
left for lunch.

mountain face blocks any further exploring to the south and east,
while the forest streches on to the north and to the west. A fallen
log lies here, softing morning due and rain spray clinging to it's
sparkling bark. No rotting scent seems to come from it as most
logs would emit.

The trail leading south from here starts sloping downward into a

this is a rarely travelled part of the forest even by it's own
standards. A small mouse-deer runs across the trail, followed by
a lazy looking lynx. To the north you can just make out a clearing
through the trees, and there seems to be movement.

The Bonanza~
Standing here at the south-west end of the Brownie-Pixie Bonanza
Festival, your senses are quickly overloaded with sight, sound
and smell. Brownies clad in soft brown cloth with little feathered
hats mingle happily with their slightly smaller and greener cousins,
the forest pixies. An almost musical chitter-chatter fills the
air, while the aroma of freshly baked treats drift in from the
north. There seems to be a forest dweller's competition, what
with the many games the pixies and brownies seem to be playing. A tug
of war is currently in progress, with the heaving Brownies having
a slight lead over the grunting Pixies.

Bonanza is in full swing.  In the centre of the clearing is an old
Myrtle tree, under the shade of which some revellers have taken to
rest.  A lone thrush sighs from a branch of the tree.  To the west

feasting of the Great Pie of Friendship. A great huge pumpkin pie
the size of farmer's cart stands proudly on a stone table with a white
tablecloth amidst a bodyguard regiment of apples, peaches, raspberries
and cookies. The dozens of eager eaters seem a bit impatient,
apparently this year's Bonanza Chairman (or Grand Pooh-ba) hasn't
opened the ceremony yet.

There is a sheer drop to the south, while moutains stretch on as far
as your eyes can see. The terrain belows seems mostly rock and stone
and has spare vegetation. You can just make out a small path heading
roughly to the east through a cluster of bushes and trees.

Within a garden~
You've managed to stumble into an oriental home. A small wooden hut
sits to the south of a garden lovingly nurtured with blooming yellow,
white and red flower blossoms. Two stone lions sit on wooden pillars
guarding entrance to the garden, while two jade dragons guard the door
to the hut proper. A small bucket pulled well stands next to a pen of
chickens and ducks who cluck and quack away merrily. Carrots, cabbages
and rice are grown in a medium sized plot of land to the north. There
is a small rock pool to the east.

circumference. Peering into the pool, the unmoving mirror like surface of
the water reflect your image. There is no way of knowing exactly how deep
the pool is, but it must be very deep since you can't see the bottom. There
is a small wooden bench here beckoning you to sit and rest for a while,
and ponder things you've put aside, and think on matters you've forgotten.

You stand in the living room of a small wooden hut. A small partioned
kitchen is to the south of here. The spartan furniture, tidiness and
simple basic furniture hint at the occupier's character. There is a
beautiful painting of a young oriental women dressed in long flowing
silk on one of the walls. Parchments with foreign exotic wordings in
flowing black ink script sit on a desk. A small book catches your eye,
it's title being "Zhuge Liang's Chinese-Theran Dictionary". Some of
the scrolls here are written in a language you can understand.

@eng The Ruined Monastery@rus  ~
@eng Tangled vines of ivy hang down from what remains of the arch-entranced
of this small monastery.  It is ruined beyond repair and seems to have
been abandoned many years ago.  There is a quiet and melancholic silence
in the air.  You notice footprints in the dust that lead west into a
leaf-strewn courtyard and continue into a small chapel.  You notice for
the first time that that area of the monastery seems to have been spared
the dereliction that the rest of the monastery has fallen into.

Evidently the chapel is looked after for the floors are swept, pews wiped
and the stained-glass windows in good working order. A modest pulpit
made of mahogany with a carved pine cross attached to it faces a few rows
of wooden benches. Probably cared for by questing paladins or clerics
on a pilgrimage, you wonder if any of the faithful might be nearby. To
the west wall you see a hole large enough for you to squeeze through.

chapel within a monastery. Birdsong fills the air while butterflies
yellow and red flutter about happily. A tall large oak brings shade
further west, but all movement to the north and south is prevented by a
combination of trees and the old stone walls of the monastery. There
is a serenity and a sense of life and peace, hinting that it is often
used by others as a place of worship or contemplation.

walls and bright tapestries drape the rough wooden furniture and curtained
glass windows. Odd pieces of silver and crystal are sitting upon a long
trestled table in the middle of the room.. Flowers from the forest, all cut
and arranged blossom from various vases and clay pots. The whole cottage
looks bright and cheerful even with nightfall. Obviously, someone with

You walk into a much smaller room filled with sculptures instead of small
ornaments: over a hundred of them, lining the walls in holographic niches
as well as scattered around the floor on ornate pedestals. The variety, as
you have come to expect, is astonishing, ranging from human-style chunks of
simple stone and wood to others that were more like tethered living creatures
than works of art. Each is illuminated by a flaming blood candle, giving a
sharp contrast to the darkness around. You can barely make out a huge bed
that lies in the northeast corner of this gloomy room. Several other portals
seem to lead out of this room. You wonder where they may lead to...
