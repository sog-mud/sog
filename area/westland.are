Welcome to Westland. This is one of the two lands that are in
this world. There is a great wizard named Darken Rahl who
wishes to rule the two lands. D'Hara is the more powerful of the
two lands. One reasons is, that several million years ago, the
greatest wizards of all had created two lands. The Westlands was
the only land that had no magic what-so-ever. He also divided the
two lands with a magical Boundry. This boundry was created to
stop all magic from  going into the other land.

D'Hara.  This is Darken Rahl's home land and he is most powerful
here. Even though he is powerful you might still be able to
defeat him. Beware of the Azrith Plains for they are huge and go
from north to west to east and to south. It is very easy to get
lost in the Plains so try to fined the way to Darken Rahl and the
People's Palace before it is too late or you get lost! You really
must hurry for Darken Rahl has almost won the battle and will
control the lands!

Path By a Lake.~
You are walking beside a beautiful lake that is crystal
clear. There is a fresh breeze in the air and the trees are
rocking freely. You feel as though you are entering a new world
but you're still in Muddy. The lake to your right is crystal
clear and calm. There are a family of ducks floating by seeming
not to notice you. The woods around you are flled with deer,
birds, and other animals. The trees are tall and lush, leaving
not much room for the sun to enter into these sacred lands. The
path continues to the north and, of course, where you came from,
the south.

A Clearing in the Woods.~
As you come out of the forest you enter a clearing in the
woods. This clearing isn't very big but it sure is good to see
the sun again. There are two large signs nailed on a tree leading
back into another forest. You wonder what the sign says and go to
take a closer look. There are two exits here by the lake. One
goes south to the path and the other goes north into the woods
again.

Welcome! Here you are in the middle of a forest beside Trout
Lake. The road you are walking on goes to the north and back to

sure is wonderful.

As you walk down the road you come across a path leading up
into the mountains. Since going north will lead right into the
lake you must go west up into the mountains. There is a little
rabbit drinking from a small pond infront of you. You wonder
where such a beeatiful creature came from. You could still go

As you approach the mountains, you leave the forest behind
to open air space. The wind here is blowing more swiftly and the
sun is even hotter. You notice the giant waywarrd pines that loom
overhead. You wonder where such wonderous trees came from. The
path up the mountain looks like a nice and easy one to take. You
could retrun to the east or go up the mountain.

are now in Upper Ven. Upper Ven is the mountain before the city.
The path look quite clear and easy to pass. The rocks are warm in
the suns' rays and is just gleaming with the heated mirage.  You
may go north or down.

The path leads back into another forest and seems appealing to
you to get out of the sun. The forest is filled with trees and
shrubs all changed colors by the on comming season. The gold and
bronze colors of the leaves are quite beautiful and look as if
they are each worth morth then life itself. The mountaint air is
freash and cooling and makes you feel like you want to sit down
and rest. You may go down or south.

The Trail in the Forest.~
You have entered the forest near the town of Hartland. The
path is outlined with bright yellow flowers and little purple
plants. There is a little shack to the east that doesn't look to
welcoming. The forest isn't very thick and you can see all around
you. There are wild ferns and other plants that you have never
seen before. You see one plant you recconize, but it is from a
book. This forest seems to be quite a sanctuary. The trail goes
north to the outskirts of Hartland or up back to the mountain.

You are on the out skirts of a little town called Hartland.
The road you walk on is dry and dust covered. Its seems like it
hasn't rained for quite sometime. Up ahead you can see the town
begining to form. The town has many people in the streets
gathering for some kind of bizzard but there is nothing for sale
here. All the villagers are gathering around a speaker who is
giving a speech about fire. The city looks like its full of happy
people, all with wonderous jobs and families. The exits are north
and south.

You have walked into the town of Hartand. Everyone here
seems to be happy and joyful. They all seem to be listening to a
speech about fire which doesn't interest you. You see how the
speaker talks and catches his audiance and it shows that he has
some great deal of authority. You wonder why such a small man
could have so much power over all these people. There are little
homes all around but seem un-welcoming. You can go north to the
paths in the fields or south back to the woods.

The Fields of Hartland.~
You have entered the fields outside of the town and are on
your way to South Haven. Near South Haven is where the Narrows
are. In order to get to South Haven you must cross the swamps on
the way. The air here is suprizingly still and peaceful. There
are few trees around and even fewer animals. The trail leads
south to a swamp that steals your breath away with stench, and
north back to the town you came from.

The Path to the Swamps.~
As you walk along the trail the forest begins to get thicker
and thicker. The trail becomes more and more hidden and a mist
begins to grow. The trees begin to bunch together and the sun has
been blocked from view. The air is still and musty and it is
starting to get colder. In the distance towards the boundary, you
hear the cries of the heart hounds as they are comming out to
hunt. Just when you thought things could get no worse, you spot a
quad of assassins out in the trail before you. Better be careful.
The trail leads north and back to the city, south.

guess you're safe. The trees are beginning to look old and dry
and the ground begins to get muddy. The cries of the heart hounds
are much closer now and you begin to panic. The trail continues
to the east and south.

The Path at the swamp.~
You have arrived at the swamp at the same time as the heart
hounds. The heart hound will not enter the swamp so it must be
your only choice..or fight. The swamp looks univiting and you
don't know what sort of creatures live under the murky waters.
There is a small island in the center of the swamp that seems
deserted. The waters in the swamp are shallow enough to pass by
foot. You better make diside fast, fight or get to the island.
The exits are back east or west.

As you are crossing the waters you notice that the hounds don't follow
you.  The water is refreashing and cool.  The island is just up ahead and
you can't wait to get there.  You notice the water starts to move and then
you see them.  Snakes.  Little yellow deadly snakes.  All over the place. 
You start to run as fast as you can towards the island.  You could go east
to the island or back west.

you on to dry land.  The hounds are still back on the other shore and will
not enter the waters.  The hounds let out yelps of frustration.  The island
doesn't have any trees or plants.  Looking to the east you see the new path
to SouthHaven.  You wonder when you should attempt to cross the waters
again.  The exits are to the east, and to the west.

hounds have returned back to their home, in the boundary.  The swamp gets
shallower as you approach the land again and the sky goes clear.  The exits
are east the shore or back west to the island.

to the swamps (north) or continue south.

of ale. You may go north to the forest or south into the village.

hear some people talking about their weekends and what they want
to do. There is a fresh cool breeze floating through the city.

The Trail to The Narrows.~
This is a long trail that leads up to the narrows where you
will need to cross into D'Hara. The path is wide and quite
visable. There are little animals running around in the woods all
about. You notice that the trees are thicker and a lot greener.
The humidity begins to rise and it starts to feel hotter. Your
legs start to get tired when you see the Bone Woman's shack up
ahead. It would be good to visit her. Her shack is about oh..
twenty or so yards ahead and will take no time to reach it. You
spot the Narrows up ahead. The exits are north to the village or
south to the Bone Woman.

There is a shack to the west of you which must belong to the Bone
Woman. The shack looks nice and cosy. It would be nice to stay and have
a visit with the old Bone Woman. The exits are north to the

floors and an old lady stands in the center of the room. She has
a big smile on her face and offerse you to stay in her home for
as long as you wish. The exit is back to the east, out on the

of the whole narrows. The exits are west to the center or east to

The Center of the Narrows.~
You approach the center of the Narrows when you spot it. A
shadow person. They have a poisonous touch and are the
undertakers of the dead. You try to get past it without making
him attack. The sky is getting dark and you still have a little
ways to go. The exits are in an east-west direction, west being
the way you want to go.

Near The End of the Narrows.~
You are approaching the end of the narrows. You give a sigh
of relief that you are almost out of this dreaded place. The sun
is setting out ahead of you making it hard to see your way. The
air starts to cool down as the sun sets in the west. You try to
hurry your way out of the narrows before dark. The exits are of
course; east and west.

The End of The Narrows.~
You have reached the end!!! Yay!..... Uh Oh!!! The sun has
set and right before your eyes materializes The Spirit King. He
is not going to let you pass. You must fend off this naughty
beast and get to Darken Rahl. The exits are to the west and to
the east.

The Azrith Plains.~
Welcome to D'Hara! You have successfully passed through the
narrows and are standing infront of the Azrith Plains. The plains
are quite massive and reach as far as your eyes can see. In the
distance, you see the home of Darken Rahl, the Peoples Palace.
You have to cross the Azrith Plains in order to get to Darken
Rahl in his massive palace.
The exits are north and east.

The Path Through the Plains.~
You have found a path that is quite long but leads to Darken
Rahl's Palace. The path is covered with stones and there is an
occassional tree here and there. The sky is bright and clear and
it is a hot day. You start to be thirsty and you feel sort of
tired. Your only choice is to go ahead onto the Peoples Palace
and stop Darken Ralh then steel a drink and a bite to eat. The
way back through the Narrows doesn't seem appealing. The exits
are north and south.

The Azrith Plains.~
You notice that you have traveled quite far and are almost
at the Palace. You feel a sudden urge to stop and go back but
then it passes. You see ahead of you a giant Dragon blocking your
trail. Maybe she will listen to you and move out of the way.
Maybe she will eat you up for breakfast... Hmmmmmm...Breakfast
sure would be nice. The exits are north and south.

At the BIG scary DRaGoN!~
You approach the dragon and notice that she is the biggest
most frightening beast you have ever seen. The dragon hardly
notices you as you try to get by. Maybe you should TRY to kill it
so you wont have to fight it on the way back...Maye you should
just turn around and go back to mommy for some cookies...mmmm
cookies. STOP THINKING ABOUT FOOD! You must go on and kill Darken
Rahl. The exits are North and South ass usual.

Finally you're at the Peoples Palace. This palace sure is
big. Bigger then anything you have ever seen. The doors are ten
times as big as you, yet they stand open..as if you're being
expected. The stairs are made from white marble and are spotless.
The exits are north into the palace or south to the BIG scary
DRaGoN.

The Long Hallway.~
You enter the Palace and head down a long hallway. There are
many people wandering about this castle and others are praying or
chanting about Darken Ralh. You pass one Devotion Room afilled
with these people. You decide not to stop and keep on going. The
exits are to the north, south and to the east there is a room
filled with devoters.

The Devotion Room.~
This room is filled with people, heads bowed to the floor
chanting a harmonic tune. There is a giant pool in the center of
the room filled with water. The place looks like an indoor
garden. You get shivers up your spine just at the sight of all
these people devoted to Darken Rahl. The exits are north and back
west.

This room is filled with the horid smell of blood and sweat
combined. There are people chained to beams and women dressed in
red leather torturing them. The floors are covered in blood. The
moment you enter this room you regret it. The Mord-Siths have
spotted you and are heading in your direction. Better run FAST!

surrounding this room...

You have found Darken Rahl! The door opens automatically before
you. You may enter or go back to the Mord-Siths.

The Garden of Life.~
This is a cavernous room filled with wonders sorts of
magical plants. Leaded windows high overhead let in the light for
the lush plants. Around the outside of the room are flowers set
in beds, with walkways winding through. Beyond the flowers are
small trees, short stone walls with vines covering them, and
well-tended plants completing the landscaping. Except for the
windows overhead, this room mimics an outdoor garden. In the
centre of this expansive room is an area of lawn that sweeps
around almost into a circle, the grass ring broken by a wedge of
white stone, upon which sits a slab of granite, smooth but for
grooves carved near the edge of the top, leading to a small well
in one corner. It is held up by two short fluted pedestals.
Beyond the slab stands a polished stone block set next to a fire
pit.  In the centre of the lawn lies a round area of white
sorcerer's sand, ringed with torches that burn with fluid flames.

The only exit is south.
