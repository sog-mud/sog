A Shining Vault~
The stones of the pyramid here take on a strange, twinkling quality,
almost seeming to shine with an internal light.  As you look closer you
see tiny glass-like glittery particles within the stones, that reflect
the light from your light source so perfectly that they seem to shine.

A Massive Sand Dune~
You stand now on a massive sand dune on the southern side of
the pyramid.  At the foot of the sand dune to the north you see a
small hole where the stones of the pyramid have collapsed.  Not
far to the south is a massive roiling sandstorm; the wind from the
storm howls and bites at your face even here.

A Massive Sand Dune~
Somehow you managed to make your way through the howling winds
of the sandstorm, and clamber up on this sand dune.  You can see the
storm to the north of you, and presumably the pyramid is somewhere
beyond it.  Nothing but flat, featureless, open dunes of sand lie in
every other direction.
