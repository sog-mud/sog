This old giant warrior has spent all his time on martial arts. He

staffs. Even he had never used a magical item. Those shows how he
hates magic.

The entrance to the Caven of Battlerager~
You see some sort of light coming thru the west, making the inside of
the caven more noticable. You see lots of weapon and blood tracks on the
wall. There are several bones on the ground. You notice that the huge man
looking over you before you moving on.

Deep in the caven~
You see that there are two openings more in the caven, one to the north
and one to the south. To the north you see a large white throne. To the
south you see some clothes and weapons left on the ground. It seems that
the south is something like a donation room.

The donation room~
You find lots of weapons and clothings on the floor. You noticed the
writing on the floor.
      "Every battlerager is your brother."
Then you change your mind, and want to put some good clothing and weapon
here for all other cabal members to strengten themselves, and to destroy
magicians.

Gordall's Weapon House~
You see the metals hung up on the wall, shining brilliantly. Most

 * 3) Only clerics and paladins, which are not members of Shalafi, *
 *    can be tolerated, unless their magic is not casted on you.   *
 * 4) If one caster is beyond commandment 3, you should terminate  *

 * 5) You should be afraid of any form of enemies. You ought to be *
