oak tree ancient wise~
an ancient oak~
An ancient oak leaned its branches over the trail.~
Centures ago this giant spreading oak was a small sprout with several
leaves. Now it's the oldest tree in this forest and in the world with
mighty branches and magnificent leaves. You see small hollow and a grey
squirrel living here. This tree knows about all thing you can find in
any place and Gods took oak under their protection. So even don't try
to attack it or cause in any way.

bear forest brown~
a forest bear~
A brown forest bear casually strolls through his wooded domain.~
This large fellow, a forest dweller, has brown fur which matches
his brown eyes - which very nearly match his yellowish-brown teeth,
which he looks to be interested in matching with your neck, skull
and other parts. The undisputed ruler of this forest, he is arrogant
in his disdain of your presence.

A quasit imp lurks through the shadows along the ground.~
This little (relatively) quasit appears to have taken over a small cave
within the pixie forest.  His leathery grey skin, horns, bony frame and
spiked tail mark him as a minor demon, perhaps here of his own accord,
or perhaps to keep a watchful eye on the forest's creatures...
