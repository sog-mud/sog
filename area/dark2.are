A path~
The path comes to an abrupt halt.  The boulders curve inward,
towards the city, and with the aid of the sharpened stakes all
about you travel in this direction has been effectively cut off.

A small path~
This small path leads you away from the ancient road, along

You are approaching the end of the palm path.  Several buildings
to the north of you appear to be both warehouses and living
quarters.  The smell of drying fish is evident and a small fishing
boat has been drydocked for repair.

Entrance to Land's End~
Land's End is a small fishing village with such a small population it doesn't
appear on any maps.  Two large warehouses and two homes are the only standing
buildings.

Land's End Road~
This is the only "road" in Land's End.  The most accurate
description would be a path.  On both sides of you stand large
warehouses where tradegoods are stored.  A few fishing nets
hang from nearby trees and a drying rack produces that strong
fish smell which spreads through the air.

Two homes stand nearby as well as a rowboat and three fishing

Garden along the river~
The garden continues to parallel the mountain river.  While walking
through the carrots you glance south into the river and see the
remains of a wooden bridge washed ashore.  The bridge is flimsy
and ill made and obviously was not meant to be permanent.

to have been trampled.

From this part of the garden you have an excellent view of the
river as it passes through the fence.  A huge section of the
12 foot high fence is missing above the river.  Perhaps a massive
rain washed that section of the fence away?

The tracks you see are well defined and
were obviously made by an unshod foot.
The toes are extremely long and end with

soldiers while the unshod footprints appear to have been made
by nonhuman feet.  The prints are elongated and end in talons.

Strips of cloth are embedded in the mud and stuck to bushes
and the yellowing bones of two or three skeletons are scattered

Small path at river's edge~
This small path has seen little traffic in recent times.  There
are obvious signs of use by small animals, tracks, droppings, etc..
however, no man sized creatures have passed this way for years.
The river is rushing past you and flows through the large hole in
the fence to your right.  Perhaps a large rain washed it away?

You are on the river which flows south of Malo Village.  To

surrounds the village.  To the east is a large hole in the fence.
The river runs through that hole.
