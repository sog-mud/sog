A Dark Alleyway~
The walls of the alleyway have been spray-painted over many times
over the years.  One section of graffiti actually looks legible,
it says:    This section has been designed for levels 5 through 10
            If you are above level 15 please don't expect much fun.
            If you are below level 5 enter at your own risk.
Another section of graffiti says "Raff Rules!"
There is a boulevard to the east and Emerald Avenue is visible to the west.

Beginning of White Dragon Boulevard~
This section of town has been overrun by the Troll gang.  Even the
police stay out of here for fear of being brutalized.  This was once
a nice lower-middleclass neighborhood, but know the gangs run the
streets.  All the shops and homes have been boarded up and abandoned.
An alleyway is to the west and the street continues east.  An over-
grown lot is to the south.

NO MAN'S LAND~
This is the section of town between the two gang's territories.  This
is usually where the violence starts.  No Man's land continues north,
east, and west; or there is a street to the south.

Another corner of Hector and Achilles streets~
Achilles street heads to the south and Hector runs east and west.
There is an entrance to "No Man's Land" to the north.  On the
southwest corner of this intersection, it looks like a building
was recently burned down.

A small ruined chapel~
This was a small temple built to honor the minor gods and goddesses.
It is now desecrated by graffiti and vandalism.  Perhaps its worst
defilement is that it is the hangout of the Ogre gang.  There is a street to
the east through a rusty metal door.

First intersection of Hector and Achilles~
There is a large statue here depicting a battle between two
great warriors.  You think it's odd that it has not been defiled,
but then you sense a aura protecting it.  Achilles runs east
and south, while Hector heads out to the north.

What is left of the weaponshop~
It doesn't even look like those punks gave the weaponsmith a
proper burial.  But what a going away present he seems to have
received!  Blood is splattered and dried all over the walls here.
It looks like a great deal of carnage happened here.  The way
out to the east leads out onto a street.

Khan Park~
Not really a "park" as you and i would think of it but
it seems queerly peaceful here in comparison to the rest of
the area.  There seems to be some kind of memorial to the
great Mongol warrior Khan being crudely constructed here.
There is a street to the east and another to the south.

A wide alleyway~
The sides of the alleyway have been vandalized many times.
One patch of graffiti actually looks readable:
            This section has been designed for levels 5 through 10
            If you are above level 10 please don't expect much.
            If you are below level 5 enter at your own risk.
In another spot it says "now entering Ogre territory..."
A street lies to the west and a major road to the east.
