zombie disgusting rotting~
a disgusting, rotting Zombie~
A horribly disgusting zombie is here, looking to devour the living.
~
You can't tell if this was once a man or a woman, or even what race it
once was.... Just that it is horribly decayed, and appears to be
missing a few chunks of flesh, like something else had been eating off
of it.
 The zombie seems oblivious to you, until you draw close enough for it
to make its kill.

zombie~
the Juju zombie~
A pale, withered man stands here, staring at you with an immense hatred.
~
This greyish skinned creature was once probably a powerful adventurer, such
as yourself, before it was slain and reanimated for some dark and powerful
creature. Upon closer examination, you notice that the thing before you
actually has no eyes, but instead a faint red glow eminates from it's eye
sockets.

A dark-skinned wizardress stands here, raising the dead.
~
Fear grips you upon looking at this frail, young looking creature, when you
realize what it truly is... a Dark-elf enchantress which has become a
creature of the undead.
She looks a bit hungry after having a full day of reanimating corpses,
perhaps you will be her dinner?

Outside of the mausoleum~
The skies seem eternally dark and cloudy here, and the stench of
death is almost overpowering as you stand north of the huge grey stone
building. There are numerous heavy footprints in the dirt leading into
and out of this accursed place, along with many deep grooves as if
something heavy has been dragged inside.
You hear a faint howling from within, and sense an occassional rustling
in the graveyard surrounding you. Suddenly, it dawns on you that
entering here may be a very bad idea...
A sign is posted, urging caution.
~

sign~
This area is for high level characters only... 25 to 50+, and most
everything is aggressive, so keep in large groups of high levels.
Once you go in, there may be no coming back alive... you have been
warned.

behind you and realize that you have indeed made a mistake.
 To the north is the entryway back to the graveyard, to the south is
the main area of the mausoleum.
 Corpses litter the ground, obviously being dragged here for some vile
purpose. You have an urge to leave this place now.

The workroom of Shadar Lunn~
The room is very orderly and neat, except for a pile of gore and body
parts against the far wall.  Weapons are displayed neatly in cases, and a
suit of armor lies ready to be donned at a moment's notice.  The occupant is
obviously a very organized, however twisted, individual.

The dark priest's coffin room.~
This room has several black candles burning, and a small shrine to the
god of Chaotic Evil, Loki. There is not much more worth noticing, besides
the rancid odor coming from the opened crypts nearby.

A pile of bodies lies by the doorway here, while burdened zombies dump
more corpses slowly in with the rest. To the west appears to be some
sort of important room in the building.
