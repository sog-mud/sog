The change of nature does not cause the change of court nor does the 
change of court cause the change in nature.  With the fae such things as 
cause are irrelevent, they simply are.  It is one of the things that make 
the fae so able to facinate mortals. 
~
E
page1~
The Seelie and Unseelie houses are the cornerstone of the fae nature.  
The Seelie is all that is chivalrous, good, fair, beautiful, light and 
graceful while the Unseelie is the counterpart of each of these 
qualities.  Just as the fae court switches alliances with each season so 
do individual fae.  While being immortal in nature, the fae are not 
unchanging.  The fae switch from one court to another at times within 
their existence.  The change is one of internal alliance and a once 
honest and loving Seelie fae can become a dishonest and distrusting one 
by changing courts.

The Fool seems to also ignore the house differences.  He seems to owe no 
particular alliegence to either court and seems to retain full use of his 
seemingly addled faculties throughout the year despite the seasonal 
variences that so affect his kind.
~
E
page1~
Puck is perhaps the single most powerful of all the fae.  Even Gwyn ap 
Nudd and Oberon pay this wanderer heed.  While usually he is nothing more 
than a trickster it seems that he is the only fae that has not gone a 
change of roles since the last cycle of fae existence. Why the Fool is 
exempt from these yearly changes is a mystery that only he may know and 
as is his nature he isn't telling.

you saw from the bottom must have just been something created by a 
combination of the light, the mist and your imagination because there is 
not castle here.  There is however a small standing stone with some worn 
engravings on it.  The only exit is down.

The Forest Edge~
You stand on the edge of a great forest.  Ancient trunks extend form 
the earth up into the heavens seemingly holding up the sky itself.  
Further into the forest it seems as if the sky is the trees as the canopy 
above obscures all but fleeting glimpses of blue skies.  A meadow extends 
to the north and the forest extends to the south and west.

Used in former days to greet visitors this room remains only the 
vestiges of hospitality.  There are several tattered banners hanging from 
above and a few comfortable, if dusty, pieces of furniture sitting in 
various places around the room.  To the north is a bedroom, the south 
the path to the meadow, the east the kitchen and the trophy room is to 
the west.

The Trophy Room~
In dusty, locked cases all around the room you get glimpses of the 
finest sets of armor, weapons, clothing, and gems you have ever seen.  
Woven tapestries of immortal battles lie rotting in the cases beside 
still gleaming swords in scabards covered in myriad patters of 
interlocking spiral beadwork.  The treasured creations of some of the 
realm's finest craftsmen lay in these cases just beyond your grasp.  To 
the north is a bedroom and to the south you hear sounds of metalworking.

inhabits every item in this hall, but one item especially calls to you.  
A tapestry on the east wall depicts two young figures, one boy and one 
girl.  For a moment you long for the lost innocence of that youth and you 
yearn to enter the tapestry, but then you pull yourself away from it's 
strange lure.  The hall continues north and south.

This hall is all green leaves and grass of a summer day.  Golden 
raidience shines down from the open roof above and birds chirp.  From 
somewhere you hear a brook babbling.  The eastern wall is dominated by a 
tapestry that shows two lovers in the prime of their life, and passions, 
in a summer field.  You sense that if you entered the now shimmering 
tapestry you too would be forever young and beautiful, unchanging and 
untouchable.  The tapestry dims and you hear laughter in the distance.  
The hall continues to the north and south.

clouded grey sky above this chamber. There is a soft quiet sense to this room,
and when you look at the tapestry on the west wall depicting a middle 
aged couple resting quietly in each others arms you long for quiet 
companionship and find yourself reaching toward the tapestry.  You are 
shaken out of the trance by a raven's croak and you stand for a moment 
confused.  The hall continues to the north and south.

the treelike branches above are covered to near breaking with ice.  A cold 
wind blows with a shrill sound through the hall.  Totaly unmoved by the 
wind is a bright white tapestry on the west wall that shows an old couple 
whose faces show infinite wisdom and complacency.  You are entranced by 
the wisdom that the old couple wears like a mantle and you suddenly 
desire to seek it out by joining them in the tapestry. Then you hear a 
high pitched cackling and you shiver with the cold.  The Hall continues 
to the north and south.
