king welmar~
King Welmar~
The wise King Welmar sits here in his throne.~
In his later middle-age, with his beard starting to grey, King Welmar
is still very powerfully built, and wouldn't take kindly to an attack.
Despite that, you know he is well-loved throughout the land, and has
a reputation as a wise and just ruler.

Peter, the Captain of the Royal guard~
Peter, the Captain of the Royal guard, walks around inspecting.~

you realise none of them would stand a chance against this man in a
fight. He stands at least two metres tall, but still moves with an
almost feline grace. He actually radiates strength and confidence,
and you have to fight a sudden urge to come to attention as you see
him.

Ergan the Murderer~
Slumped in a corner you see Ergan, the Murderer of Townsbridge.~
You remember a time almost a decade ago, when the news of the day
was how this man had slaughtered the entire population of the little
village of Townsbridge. He was imprisoned, and here he is: a shadow
of the undoubtedly great warrior he once was, but still to be reckoned
with.

You are standing on the King's Road. Before you is a large
Castle, evidently built not so much for strength as for beauty.
It is not totally without defences, though, for it is surrounded
by a deep moat, and its windows are just narrow slits for archers
to shoot through. To the north there is a drawbridge across the moat.

The King's Bedroom~
This is a large room, with a wonderful view. To one side of the
room, stands a large four-poster bed. All around the room there are
massive bookshelves, filled with all kinds of books. The titles include
works such as: 'A Treatise on the History of Midgaard and surrounding
areas', 'Magic - A Beginner's Introduction' and many others. There is
an exit to the west.

Most of the books seem worn, as if thoroughly studied. The King
evidently is interested in keeping himself educated.

Seems nice enough to sleep in, though you would never dare to, since
it is a Royal Bed!

A dry tome, filled with boring knowledge.

Beginner? This book goes beyond most of what YOU know about magic
anyway. But then, there are levels of magical knowledge, it seems.

Up in the Tower~
After a long climb, you finally reach the top of the tower. This
room is small, and the only light source is a flickering candle, on
a cluttered table, in the middle of the room. The only obvious exit
is back down the stairs.

The Top of the Tower~
You have arrived at the top of the tower. This tower is pretty
uninteresting, and seems made purely for reasons of defence and
guarding. The windows are slits for bowmen, very narrow on the
outward side and broad inwards to allow a wide shooting angle.
The only evident exit is down the stairs again.

The Top of the Tower~
This is the highest of all the towers, and is obviously used for
lookout purposes. The view is splendid in all four directions. All
around you, the rich countryside spreads out to the horizon. To the
north and east you see a vast mountain range, and far to the west
a beautiful lake. A bit closer, the town of Midgaard lies at the
end of the King's Road. The only exit you can see is down again.
