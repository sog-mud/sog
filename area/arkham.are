A Trail~
Trees spring up around this hard-packed dirt trail, and though it is tiny
it seems to have been traveled recently. North and south of you is more
forest, with its narrow trail the only sign of human life.

The Hidden Glade~
Parting the undergrowth, you step in a small glade.  Quiet and 
peaceful, you relax in the beauty of the forest.  Small Sprites and 
Fairies dance around a calm pool, offering you a cool drink.  You feel 
at peace with yourself and the forest around you.

The Guildmaster's Cabin~
Built from the logs of sturdy cypress trees from the Vale of Clover,
the Guildmaster's cabin has a homely feel to it.  Oaks have grown their
low branches across the roof of the cabin and any number of small forest
animals race along the length of the porch.  Elesar of the Woods is here,
instructing a young woodkeeper.

Outcast Knight's Bar~
You are standing at the enterance, west of the practice yard. The place 
is gloomy lit, and no windows can be noticed. The bothering silence makes 
you think that this place was abondoned long time ago.  Two young man 
bareing longswords guard the doorway to the east.

The Torture Chamber~
This unholy guild of yours does not contain many combat weapons, and 
armors. About the center of the room is a book stand, and an old black 
book resting closed on it. The book seems to represent the spells of the 
evil. This place also does not have any windows, what makes you feel 
strong and safe here. Guildmaster's torture tools are spread all around 
the room.

Knight's Cafe~
You are standing at the middle of an huge hall.  The ceiling is very 
high over your head, but you can see the perfect carvings on it.  Near 
the walls, round marble blocks rise up to the ceiling.  On the north wall 
is a big picture of an old priest.  Two body armors stand like guarding 
the picture. There is a doorway, guarded by  two knights at the  
enterance, to the east, seems leading to a large room.

You are at the place, where maybe the best, to learn what the weapon is 
and how they can be controlled. The walls are decorated with large and 
valuable tapestries. One great sword and one axe are standing near the 
opposite walls. Short swords and light shields are hangingon the wall.

"Grorg's jewels"~
You step inside the large room and your eyes almost blinded by glittering
of brilliants and diamons on the show-windows. Grorg, the jewel master,

all the treasures you want: shimmering with a white light pearls, drawing
your mind with it's darkness onyxes, rubies like a pieces of hearts and
