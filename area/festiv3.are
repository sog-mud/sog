flow above the entrance tower. Opened gates invite you to
enter the town.

Над входной башней трепещут и вьются яркие флаги.
Открытые ворота приглашают тебя войти в город.

@eng Fountain@rus У Фонтана~
@eng Children play in the fountain, having ventured down into the
shallow stone bowl, darting in and out of the spray, laughing
and teasing one another. Light catches the water and creates
small, shimmering rainbows.

@rus Дети играют в фонтане, ныряя в каменной чаше бассейна,
стрелой устремляясь под струи и выскакивая обратно, смеясь
и гоняясь друг за другом. Свет, преломляясь в воде,
образует маленькие сверкающие радуги.

@eng The Lawn@rus Лужайка~
@eng A grassy flat spreads all around a great stone basin. A fountain
at the center of the basin spouts a plume of water that arches
high into the air in a feathery spray.  People are seated all
across the lawn and at the edge of the fountain.

@rus Заросшая травой лужайка окружает большой каменный бассейн.
Фонтан в центре бассейна извергает струи  воды, распадающиеся на
капли высоко в воздухе. Люди разместились по всей лужайке и на

@eng Deserted Lawn@rus Пустошь~
@eng Earlier it was a lawn. But mage's casts deserted it and you
can see only the sands.
@rus Раньше тут был луг, но заклинания волшебников 
выжгли его и превратили в пустыню. Теперь здесь
только ветер перегоняет песок.

but under your feet you can barely see a dark hole. May be
there is a way home?
@rus Продравшись сквозь кусты, ты понимаешь, что 
вернуться обратно на север тебе не удасться.
Однако под корнями виднеется темная нора.
Возможно она куда-нибудь и приведет тебя...

@eng You step under the arch of a huge cavern. An underground lake
fills almost all space of the cavern. In the middle of the
lake you see a small island and you realize, that the light
catching your eyes flows just from this place.
@rus Ты вступаешь под величественные своды огромной пещеры.
Подземное озеро занимает почти всю пещеру. В центре
озера виднеется островок, и ты обнаруживаешь, что свет,
бьющий тебе в глаза исходит как раз оттуда.

@eng An Underground Lake@rus Подземное озеро~
@eng The lake seems to be very deep. You wonder the beauty of
stalactites and stalagmites all around you. But do worry if
someone is hidden amidst this beauty!

@rus Озеро выглядит очень глубоким. Ты любуешься прекрасными
сталактитами и сталагмитами, окружающими тебя. Но будь
осторожен, вдруг среди них кто-нибудь прячется!

@eng A Small Island@rus Островок~
@eng A small rock rises from under the water. Up ahead you suddenly
see a glimpse of light. Trying to climb up, you fall and fall
down. Probably there is another way home? Who knows...
@rus Небольшая скала возвышается над водой. Высоко над головой
ты внезапно увидел проблеск света. Пытаясь забраться
наверх, ты срываешься и падаешь вниз. Может быть, есть
другой путь домой? Кто знает...

@eng Flying above the lake@rus Над озером~
@eng You are flying above a small island. All that you see around
is a deep gleaming lake. Up ahead you feel a flow of fresh air.
@rus Ты летаешь около маленького островка. Все, что ты
видишь вокруг - это воды глубокого, сверкающего
озера. Ты чувствуешь идущий сверху поток свежего
воздуха.

@eng Main Street@rus Главная Улица~
@eng You are walking along the main street. Brightly colored houses
are on the sides of the street. Some of them are closed, other
opened and you can catch some shadows inside. Probably, all the
inhabitants celebrate the Festival. You here some noises from
the northern part of the town.
@rus Ты идешь вдоль Главной улицы. Ярко раскрашенные дома
стоят по обеим сторонам улицы. Некоторые из них заперты,
другие открыты, и ты  замечаешь  подозрительные тени внутри.
Вероятно, все обитатели дома ушли на фестиваль. Ты слышишь
какие-то звуки, доносящиеся из северной части города.
