giant guard гигант охранник~
@eng a giant guard@rus ~~охранник~~ ~~гигант~~~
@eng A giant guard glances around, looking to stop trouble.
@rus Гигант охранник оглядывается по сторонам, готовый исполнить свой долг.
~
@eng Standing around 12 feet tall, this giant seems to keep things safe in the 
castle. I wouldn't mess with him.
@rus Ростом 12 футов, этот гигант похоже поставлен здесь для охраны вещей и 
сокровищ замка. Я бы не $gn{хотел} иметь с ним проблем.

@eng Thiulor the Spy@rus ~~местный~~ ~~шпион~~ ~~Тиулор~~~
@eng A strange giant peers at you while sneaking through the castle.
@rus На тебя пялится крадущийся по замку странный гигант.
~
Strange indeed, this giant seems to be adept at what was thought impossible
of the giants. Stealth and Guile. He is a spy for the Lord of the Giants, 
spying on the guards and making sure they are loyal to the Lord.

the Lord of the Giants~
The Lord of the Giants raises his arms and screams at your intrusion!
~
The Lord of the Giants is definately someone not to be messed with. Standing
15 feet tall, his muscles ripple and stretch all over his body, ready to 
defend his castle. You notice a dark look in his eyes as he hungers for
your blood.

giant mistress Shannon гигант госпожа шаннон~
@eng Shannon, the Battle Mistress@rus ~~воительница~~ Шаннон~
@eng Screaming at your entrance, Shannon readies her weapon and attacks!
@rus Пронзительно вскрикнув при твоем появлении, Шаннон (Shannon) вскинула оружие и напала!
~
@eng She is the epitomy of battle. Hair tossed about and muscles like that of
no other female giant you have ever seen, she seems to posses both power
and control to level anyone who challenges her.
@rus Она без ума от битв. С беспокойно равевающимися волосами и мускулами, каких
ты никогда не видел до этого у женщин гигантов, она, похоже, любит ощутить
всю свою силу и почувствовать контроль над любым, кто только посмеет к ней
обратиться.

@eng Iupsil, the Master Cleric@rus ~~Иупсил~~, ~~главный~~ ~~церковник~~~
Uttering a prayer, the Master Cleric turns to you with a smile.
~
This giants seems to be at peace with his surroundings. Praying to his god
when he is in trouble and using his magics to keep the castle in good health,
he seems just the person who you would want as a friend. (And his size makes
him seem like someone who you WOULDN'T want as an enemy)

human captain guard~
the Captain of the Castle Guard~
The Captain of the Castle Guard stands here, barking orders.
~
Strangest thing you've seen yet. The Captain of the Guards seems to be a 
human. Standing about 6 feet tall, he hardly compares to the guards around
him. His muscles have been hardened over the years of training with the 
giants and the scars over his body show him to be experienced enough to 
hold his own in combat.

An elven servant walks around, tending the castle garden.
~
He smiles when he sees you, hoping that you'll add variety to his life. He
tells you that he never gets out of the castle to visit his homeland and
longs to pay off his debt to the Lord.

A dying gnome is lying here, spitting up blood.
~
He has committed an act against the giants and is paying the price. He 
spits up blood and coughs, trying to say something to you. All that you
can make out is '..was.. framed'. He then goes into another coughing fit.

A weeping elf is chained to the wall here, struggling to break free.
~
She has gotten herself into trouble and is now in the dungeon of the giants.
Her hair matted with blood and swet makes her hardly seem as fair as elven
women usually are. She says she doesn't even know what she has been charged
with, but has to stay here for as long as they keep her.

A giant librarian sits here, nose in a book.

He lives his life exactly how he wants. With books, LOTS of books. He met
the lord once when the lord was in search of a certain forbidden piece of
literature. After bargaining with the Lord he obtained the statis of 'Castle
Librarian' and has been as pleased as can be ever since.

A human stands here with a grin, delivering pain and misery.
~
Having been a friend of the Lord's since their youth, this human seems to
share in the Lord's desire for pain and destruction. Burning elves live or
beating a gnome to death, he cares not. It is merely part of his well-paid
job.

He hardly represents royalty in a huddle mass on the floor. He was once a 
prince and was captured in a war against the giants. He now spends his days
and nights screaming from the torture, until his body finally gives up. He 
wishes someone would put him out of his misery.

@eng A dusty path@rus Пыльная тропа~
@eng The dust on this path is making it quite difficult to gather in your 
surroundings. On both sides of you are trees and you think you hear birds
chirp in the distance. Far to the north is what looks to be a Castle,
while south leads into the dwarven forests.
@rus Из-за пыли на дороге довольно трудно что-нибудь сказать об окружающей тебя
природе. По обе стороны от дороги растут деревья, и тебе кажется, что откуда-то
издалека до тебя доносится чирикание птичек. Далеко на севере должен быть
Замок Гигантов (ты на это очень надеешься), а вот на юг тропа уводит в 
Дварфовский Лес.

ты уже можешь различить в той стороне Замок Гигантов.

@eng A peaceful clearing@rus Спокойная полянка~
@eng As you enter the clearing you are surprised at the silence. Unlike the dusty
road to the south or the castle to the north, it seems to fill your body 
with thoughts of peace and happiness. You can't understand what is giving
off this sensation. The flowers? They are certainly plentiful here. Perhaps
the stone markers that seem to enclose this clearing from the rest of the
forest. No matter. It makes you feel good... that's it.
@rus Как только ты $gn{вступил} на полянку, тебя сразу же поражает царящая здесь тишина
В отличие от пыльной дороги на юге и замка на севере здесь тебя заполняет
чувство умиротворенности и спокойствия. И ты не можешь понять, что же задает
тебе такое настроение. Цветы? Конечно, здесь изобилие их. А может быть это
каменные мемориалы, которые окружают полянку и защищают ее от наступления леса?
Не важно. Это хорошо, тебе здесь нравится... и больше ничего.

@eng Before the Castle of the Giants@rus Перед Замком Гигантов~
@eng Standing before the Castle of the Giants you gaze in awe at the splendid 
display of wealth and influence. Two stone lions are on each side of the
huge adamantite door north of you. Off to the south you see what looks 
like a large clearing.
@rus Стоя перед Замком ты с благоговением и трепетом вглядываешься в выставленные
напоказ роскошь и богатство. По обе стороны от огромной несокрушимой двери
на севере стоят два каменных льва. На юге виднеется что-то, очень похожее на
обычную полянку.

@eng Foyer of the Castle@rus Фойе Замка~
@eng The foyer of this castle is rather large compared to other foyers you have
seen before. The Lord of the Giants here obviously has gold to spare, as he 
has collected rare art pieces and placed them around the room. Two hallways
join here from the east and west and the gates of the castle are to the 
south.
@rus Фойе этого замка просто огромно по сравнению со всеми фойе, которые ты видел
до сих пор. Судя по тем редчайшим скульптурам и картинам, которых в комнате
очень много, сокровищница замка просто забита золотом. На север и восток идут
два широких коридора, а на юге находятся ворота замка.

The hallway is glittering with adamantite and various paintings from 
around the world. Torches line the walls making your shadow seem to have
a life of it's own. To the east you see the foyer of the castle and to 
the west the hallway continues.

The turn here is lit by a single torch. The air is thick and quite 
uncomfortable, seeming to interupt your breathing. This is not a place you
would like to stand around. Perhaps you should continue on your way...

Hunks of dried meat and blood waft your way as you enter the Lord's chamber.
Maps of the surrounding area with what look like model giant guards in 
various spots on the map. From what you see it looks like the giants are 
preparing to attack one of the world's cities. Which one? Only time can say.
Turning your attention to the Lord himself, he does not seem pleased with
your uninvited entrance to his Chamber. He quickly stands up to engage you.

next to the door and look out onto the field. You see hills, a mountainous
area, a plains area, a small stream running through, and a granite arena in
the center... All within this room. I guess it's time to prove yourself.

about it other than that it's a map, you turn to meet the occupant of this

captain is a bit smaller than the giants he commands, but is a superb 
leader, so they follow him wherever he takes them. There is a desk at the
far wall and alot of paperwork sitting on top of it, waiting to be done.

but the elf get's very little recognition of this fact.

The castle dungeon~
The smell of this place is dreadful indeed. Death hangs in a thick mist
all around you. Blood and waste litter the floor in various spots. Off
in the distance you hear screams of torture.

The Castle War Conference Room~
This is where the giants meet to discuss the relations with other races, as
well as where to move their troops. A large table diminates the center of
the room. On it you see maps of Ofcol, New Thalos, Arkham, Elvenhame and
Shire. You look and see that Thalos has been crossed off a list on a board
on the wall.

The lounge~
This room looks like that of leisure and comfort. Soft cotton pillows with
silk-laced sheets drape them. In the four corners of this room there is each 
a different chair. A throne, cushioned with a pillow of the finest elven 
silk, an ivory rocking chair bearing a cross at the top of it, a very 
uncomfortable looking spiked chair made of adamantite, and a chair that is
very hard to focus on, it shifts and changes color while blending into the
background.

The Library~
This is where the king keeps his vast collection of books he has gathered 
from the far reaches of the realms. Long ladders climb up to frightening
heights to reach those books higher up. Each wall has a book shelf on it
as well as many rows of shelves in the room itself. Those books that are a
bit more rare and hard to get are kept in the back room.

A dark room~
The only light available in this room is your own. You try to adjust your 
eyes to the darkness and begin to make out shapes along the walls, which 
you assume to be paintings. You bump into a few things, break a few things, 
and decide that you might want to leave this room.

Every type of torture device thinkable is in this room and some that you 
could have never dreamed of. There is a furnace on one of the walls and you
see branding sticks, chains and whips on a rack in the corner. Bloody,
disemboweled limbs hang on hooks from the ceiling. This is definately a place
of torture.
