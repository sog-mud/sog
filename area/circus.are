You will need a ticket to enter the Big Top.

@rus Перед собой вы видите цирк, расположившийся во всем своем величии и

большим навесом. Вам потребуется билет, чтобы пройти внутрь.
Прямо у входа стоит касса с улыбающимся билетером.

западе и востоке вас ждут палатки с атракционами и игрищами.

strong man, gasp as a man swallows a sword, see a real, Bearded Lady, 
be amazed by the midget's feats of acrobatics, and be dazzled by the great
magical powers of the Illusionist.
@rus Это место полно афиш и объявлений с описаниями атракционов предлагаемых в

атлетом, посмотреть шоу фокусников и акрабатов, удивиться их ловкости, про
ворности и умению ! Похлопать и поопладировать им, но и конечно внизу

Very big.  Colossally huge.  You don't seem to have any problem finding a seat.

@eng The Tent of the Illusionist@rus Шатер Фокусника~
@eng This tent is darkened at first.  Then it gradually lightens, although
you do not see the source of the light.  You do hear a loud breathing sound
though.  You think it may be coming from right behind you.  You think this 
because you can feel very warm breath on the back of your neck.  You turn,
and see a very large, very evil looking creature.  It's a Dragon.  It opens 
its mouth, but does not attack.  Instead it just laughs at you mercilessly.
The Dragon snorts a cloud of smoke at you.
@rus Эта палатка затемнена, но с твоим приходом мягкий свет начал наполнять
это место, хотя светильника не видно. Звуки дыхания и ветра наполняют твой
слух. Кажеться, что кто-то дышит тебе в спину. Ты обернулся и увидил огромное
чудовище !!! Это ДРАКОН. Он слегка приоткрыл свою пасть но не спалил тебя, а
только выпустил облако пара и рассмеялся.

right after the Circus came to town.  Wouldn't surprise me if he is the one
responsible.'

If Ivan the Strongman can lift those, then he really must be strong.

First Look at the Big Top~
You receive your first good look at the Big Top.  The size of this
tent was amazing from the outside, but is even more breathtaking from the 
inside.  You feel as if you are in a different world, where the sky is only
a little closer.  You see 3 Rings spread out in front of you.  A high wire
extends between poles at a dizzying height.  The 1st Ring appears to hold
a cage which contains several large lions.  The 2nd Ring is filled with clowns
who are trying to fit into a small carriage.  In the 3rd Ring, a man is 
preparing to put on a blind fold, while his assistant stands against a target.
He has a rack of knives next to him.  You may enter the 2nd Ring to the south.
To the east and west are the Grand Stands, and the Entryway is to the north.

The 2nd Ring - You'd better read the description of this room. ~
You are in the 2nd Ring.  You see a rickety carriage, which a line of
clowns are trying to squeeze into.  You've already seen many more fit into it
than could possibly fit.  The 1st Ring is to the west and the 3rd Ring is 
to the east.  A ladder on a pole here provides access to the tightrope above.
To the north is the first look a visitor to the Big Top has.  You notice that 
the 1st ring is a cage which contains several HUNGRY Lions.  Entering it would
be fairly suicidal.  It is a good thing it is locked!

On the High Wire~
You are still 80 feet up in the air.  DIRECTLY below you is the Lion's
Cage.  If you survived the fall, YOU WOULD SURELY DIE when the Lions got ahold
of you.  You note that the door is closed to the cage, so you would have very
little chance of running away if you did fall into the cage.  As you take
your eyes off the ground below, you see the end of the wire immediately to 
your west.

You try to balance on the wire, and try not to look down the 80 feet
to the ground below.  It is good thing your training as adventurer has given
you a little better sense of balance than most people.  From up here, you 
really do have a nice view, of a very long wire.  You still have a ways to go.

course, the wire goes above the lion's cage, which has an open top.  If you 
did survive the fall, you probably wouldn't feel like adventuring again.

Behind the Big Top~
This is where the show behind the show goes on.  There are a lot
of workers preparing the next act, moving animals around, and doing too much
to take much notice of you.  The workers are taking the animals to the pens
to the south.  You see some of the performers trailers off to the east.  From
inside, you hear applause from the crowd.

The Animal Pens~
From here you may enter the animal pens.  You see a large sign that
says the following:
          
          WELCOME TO THE ANIMAL PENS!!!!

     Please feel free to pet and play with any of the animals.  They
     are all very friendly, and never hurt the public.  Especially
     the Bear.  Feel free to enter his cage and pet him.

                         - The Owner


Penned underneath this is a note that says:  Beware the Bear!!!  

You may enter the Elephant Pen to the west, the Bear Pen to the south, or
the Horse Corral to the east.  Or you may return north.

The Elephant Pen~
The first thing you notice in this pen is the rather pungent odor.  Oh
my, you seem to have stepped in an extremely large pile of droppings.  Maybe 
you should leave to the north?

The Bear Pen~
This room is rather dark, and it doesn't seem to have been cleaned 
very well lately.  The Circus Owner found that he could let some of his 
security guards go and save the price of feeding the bear if he just put up
a sign inviting visitors to visit the friendly bear.  It appears you fell
for it.

The Horse Corral~
This corral is where the show horses are kept when they are not 
performing.  It is rather small for the amount of horses that are kept here.

The Strongman's Trailer~
This trailer is pretty small to you, so, it must be tiny for Ivan.
The furnishing's are spartan, and you see nothing of value.  You might want
to consider leaving before Ivan returns.

The Bearded Lady's Trailer~
This is the filthiest place you think you have ever seen.  The floor
is covered with hair clippings.  In the corner are several bottles entitled
Miracle Stu's Wonderful Hair Tonic!!  It appears the Bearded Lady must go
through that stuff like it is water.

kit, as well as several rubber swords that are standing in a small display
case.

The Midget's Tiny Trailer~
The cheap Circus Owner believes in rewarding people according to their
stature.  Accordingly, this trailer is so small that even the Midget thinks
that it is a tight fit.  The poor Midget is also the poorest paid of all the
Freaks.  But that doesn't bother him.  He has a second profession that he
practices on the side to make a little extra cash.  He also keeps a rather
large guard dog in his trailer to discourage visitors.

The Illusionist's Trailer~
This trailer seems much larger on the inside that it does on the 
outside.  You see a spacious, king-sized bed, a large table and kitchenette,
and a separate sitting room.  The longer that you look though, you see that 
all the objects in the room have a slight shimmer to them.  Closer examination
reveals that the bed is a cot, the table a nightstand, and the sitting room
is a chair.  It appears the Illusionist tries to fool even himself sometimes.

The Circus Owner's Trailer~
This is by far the biggest and nicest trailer.  If the furnishings are
any indication of the amount of money this man makes, maybe you should go into
his line of work.  The walls are covered with walnut colored wood siding, and
the furniture is of the finest workmanship.  Paintings hang on the walls, 
and there is even a medium sized icebox to keep the Owner's food fresh.

The Secret Room~
This is a small area in the back of the Circus Owner's Trailer.  You
see that this must be where he keeps the money that he makes off his employee's
hard work.  There are several objects of value in here, but you know you would
not be able to make it off The Circus property with them, so you'd better just
take the coins.  Most things here you couldn't sell easily, except the artwork.

The Clown's Room below the 2nd Ring~
This room has been cunningly hollowed out below the 2nd Ring, giving
the clown's a place to hide after they supposedly hid in the car.  This place 
is very hot.  That doesn't surprise you, as it is filled with clowns.

The Tightrope Walkers Trailer~
This trailer like most of the others shows how poorly the performers
are paid.  The tightrope walkers are forced to (or choose to?) sleep in tiny
hammocks, that you probably couldn't even fit in.

Binky's Kitchen~
A rather small room really, but the aromas drifting to you make your
mouth water.  A feast fit for a king, or an immortal is spread upon the table
before you.  You feel compelled to sit and at least taste some of the deli-
cacies.  Somehow, you know that everything you find here will be very filling,
yet completely fat free.
