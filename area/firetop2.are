Path to Firetop Mountain~
You have reached the base of Firetop Mountain. The steep impenetrable face
that rises before you is deeply gouged, as if by the claws of a gargantuan
beast. Strange red vegetation grows at the peak, hence the mountain's name.
A small dark opening in front of you allows you to enter the depths of
Firetop Mountain, domain of the evil Warlock.
You see a small sign stuck to a nearby withered tree.
     There is a small (Glowing) (Humming) tablet.
~

The sign says-

     "Welcome to Firetop Mountain, a fun- and excitement-filled area brought
to you by the Mad Elf. He hopes you enjoy yourself".

and below that-

     "Firetop Mountain was built on a DOS text-editor in November 1995 by
Yaegar for AnonyMud, though any Merc 2.2 Mud can (and is indeed welcome to)
use it".

A Guard Post~
After a short distance, the westward passage that you are following bends to
the north. At the bend there is a small niche in the wall, just large enough
for a medium-sized humanoid to stand in. A stone stool is in this niche, as
is a half-drunk flagon of some unknown alcohol, and you (correctly) assume 
that this alcove is used as a sentry post. Its inebriated occupant may be
around, so keep alert.

You are hit by the combined stench of Orc Grog, sweat, vomit, urine and
blood as soon as you enter. Repulsed, you glance about and quickly gather
that this foul place serves as some sort of recreation area for the Orcish

The Orc Kitchen~
It is here that the Orcs prepare their meals and partake of them, seated at
long filthy benches deeply scarred and stained. Pots and pans bubble and fry
atop a wood-burning cast-iron stove, and from it an Orc occasionally serves
himself some rat stew and grits. The Orcs in here seem far too engrossed in
their gastronomic acitivities to notice your presence, though doubtless they
would react strongly were you to disturb their meals.

Inside the Shipbuilder's Quarters~
This room houses the shipbuilder and his faithful dog. There are bits of
wood and tools lying about everywhere, and a section of hull serves as a 
resting bench for the shipbuilder, who can usually be found sprawled over 
it. There is a door to the west, as well as the southern one you originally
came through.

A Construction Site~
You have come across a construction site, where an effort is being made to
construct a tunnel downwards from this passage. This in itself isn't unusual-
what makes this so weird is the fact that the laborers are animated tools,
industrious picks, shovels and spades, working and singing merrily as they 
do! Some of them even stop to make smalltalk with you. You may rest here as
long as you want, as the toosl will prevent you from any harm. However, you
cannot attack them, as they are quite immune to your puny efforts.

This room is scattered with tools, planks, nails, rivets and sailcloth. You
see desks, tables and deck plans for various ships strewn about. Evidently
the Warlock is something of a nautical man. This room is usually filled
with skeletons busily constructing boats for the Warlock, and occasionally
the chief ship-builder will actually be doing his job here.
There are doors to the north and west.
