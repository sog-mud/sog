had been buried beneath it arose to return to the world. But there was still
another unforseen step required and the darkness, while searching for that
last piece, required servants to guard It. The last elf king of Myth Drannor
was one of these, and now his spectre guards the way to the greatest evil.

In the ruins of the south gate~
You stand before a pile of rubble marking the entrance to what looked to once
be a fabulous elven city. Remains of what was once great still linger even
here in the rocks and creeping undergrowth. The shattered archway leading
into the city bears the markings of elvish highlords of longpast. To the
east and west you can make out rock strewn paths around the city
battlements. South of here heads into the dark forests.

On the remains of the battlement walls~
You are standing up on the rubbled remains of the city walls. The walls are
broken and rubbled, and the walkway around them is dangerous. Cold wind blows
over you and a dark shadow from the surrounding forest seems to cover
everything. The walkway heads north or you can go down to the rubbled ruins
of the city walls.

In the ruins of the southern courtyard~
The courtyard here is shattered and ruined after the devestation of some ages
past and long forgotten conflict. Rubble has fallen freely across the once
beautiful marble courts, and the stone fountain is dry and crumbling. To the
north lies the ruins of Myth Drannor. A large collapsed archway heads south
out of the city and toward the surrounding forest.

In the corner of the stone ruins~
You are within the rubbled remains of an ancient city. Plants and weeds have
grown across everything, and much of the time it almost seems as if the
forest is trying to bury the city into the past. The ground here is level
and reasonably flat, indicating that it was probably a market or common
area.

You are within the rubbled remains of an ancient city. Plants and weeds have
grown across everything, and much of the time it almost seems as if the
forest is trying to bury the city into the past. There is a lot of wet, damp
puddles of mud in the ground here, almost like a swamp was starting to form.

Under a broken archway~
Above you is a majestic but shattered stone archway. Intricately carved signs
have been cut into it, and fine gems still lie embedded on it's surface. If
ever there was an indication of an abandoned city this is it, gems left here
untouched by even common looters and scavangers that usually haunt ruins. To
the east the ruins open out into a large open space filled with swampish weeds
and wet muddy gorund. In the distant north you can make out the ruins of some
towers.

Walking through the rubbled ruins~
You are amidst the ruins of the ancient elven city. All around you the stones
have been crushed and scattered, left to erode with time. The greatness that
was once here is long since gone and only the fine delicate stonework gives
any indication of what once was. The ruins wind north towards some towers, or
south to what appears to be a large broken archway.`

Between the Towers of Passing~
You are standing in a large open space that appears almost as if maintained
and kept clear. The rubble and overgrown forest flora seems to have avoided
this region, and the destruction is more subdued here. Three towers lead off
from the square here: a green tinted one to the north, blue tinted to the
east and a blood red one to the west. The rubbled ruins lead southwards
away from here.

Before a tower of Blue tinged stone~
You are standing at the entrance to a small but conspicuous tower. Unlike
the rest of the ancient city this tower appears to be in almost perfect
condition. The wind here seems stilled and unnaturally quiet, not even the
sound of your own footsteps seems to reach your ears. A large stone door
tinged with some strange blue colour blocks the way east into the tower.

On a crumbling bridge over a black river~
You stand on a wide but decayed stone bridge. Large portions of the span have
collapsed into the stagnant black waters beneath it, leaving huge holes that
threaten to swallow any who venture too close. To the south the ruins seem
to have become swamped with water and covered in marsh-like flora. North of
here there is a pile of rubbled ruins, most of which is impassable, but a
small section can be seen cleared away to allow some exploration.

Around you thick bushes and trees have grown from between the cracks in the
stone ground, although nowhere near as much as would be expected from the time
that the city has been here.

Before a bloody signpost~
Here in the middle of the marshy ruins there is a large wooden sign covered in
dried blood and adorned with blackened and cracked skulls. The ruins to the
north of this sign seem ominous and less disturbed than to the west, and you
notice that almost all the tracks lead out from the north, rather than into it.

At a junction in the swampy ruins~
The wet marshlands that have grown here in the ruined elven city are almost
completely taking over the land. There is very little sign in this part of the
city of what once was, and the way through is blocked by the dense swamp muck
and deep holes of water. There is a wide, cleared path leading east, and a
darker path heading west. To the south the swamps seem to recede a little.

On a dock in a bloody harbour~
You are on a collapsed and ruined dock made of rusted steel and decayed wood.
To the south you can see one of the harbours of Myth Drannor, filled with a
shallow blood red water that laps continuosly upon the ruined harbour. The
salty smell of blood fills the air, and there is something powerful and
disturbing about the way the region seems locked in time. It is as if the
bloodshed of the elves were only yesterday and not centuries ago. There is a
ruined boathouse to the north, or you can walk east across the docks. West of
here lie the marshlands of the Drannor ruins.

was on the day that the massacres occured. The river heads east where you

Here amongst the ruins of Myth Drannor a single building seems to have been
restored from the destruction. The stone building shows the signs of massive
damage that everything else shows, but it has been restored to an almost decent
level by someone or something. As you walk by the building your feet slip in
some thick, sticky fluid that gives off a terribly stench. A doorway leads
north into the building or you can go east, south or west around the rubble of
the city.

out of the harbours of Myth Drannor, and keeping it forever in a state of
bloody waters. The bones around you seem to shift slightly, and it's like
being in an earthquake of bones. The isle heads back to the west, and
there is no way through the solid blockade to the east.

Standing at the edge of a huge graveyard of ships~
Here at the northern edge of the bone isle you can see the extent of the
massacre that must have occured centuries ago. Scores of large ships and
boats have been totally demolished and left to rot in the bloody, bone
filled waters. Burnt and blasted hulls litter the entire region, and
skeletons of elves hang lifelessly from the helms and bridges of them.
There is no doubt that the forces that blocked and slayed the elves as
they tried to flee were powerful beyond anything seen in recent times. The
smashed boat graveyard is too hazardous to explore, and you can only head
back south onto the isle of elf bones.

In the ruins of the city walls~
The walls here is hollowed out for defence, but the dried skeletons that
lie scattered across the floor show that it did little good. The air is
dusty and dry, stale with ages of being kept locked up. There is slight
break in the west wall here, or you can head south along the inside of the
wall.

In the ruins of the city walls~
The crumbling walls here are just as bad as outside, and the air is stale
and stinks of death. You can head south or north.

Above a hole in the city walls~
Here in the crumbling walls of the city you can see a small hole that has
been excavated in the ground. The work is poor and hasty, and there is no
signs of life down below. The wall passage heads back north.

In a small excavated hole beneath the walls~
You are in a small hole that seems to have been dug out in a hurry. The
ground is littered with long dead elven skeletons, and there is nothing of
interest that hasn't already long been decayed. A hole leads back up, or
you can go north to what appears to be a door.

Outside a door in the crumbling walls~
You are standing in the dark tunnel beneath the city walls. For some
reason the tunnel here hasn't collapsed like most of the ruins, and there
is a large oak door in the east wall which is in extremely good condition.

You are in a tiny, bare room that is in almost perfect condition. Unlike
the rest of the ruins this room has no signs of decay or ruin, and it is
almost as if it had been built yesterday. There is, however, nothing of
interest in it but the large oak door in the west wall.

On an isle of elven bones~
You stand on an isle consisting almost purely of bones from long dead
elves. There must be thousands of bodies piled up here, all left to rot
and decay in the bloody waters. Yet somehow they seem recent, like they
were slain only recently rather than centuries ago. For a moment it seems
the isle shifts beneath you as if the bones were still alive...a chill
through you as you gaze over the isle of bones. To the east and north you
can see the ruins of many ships that were destroyed as the elves tried to
flee the massacre.

On a wet, marshland path in the ruins~
You are on a path through the marshlands that have overgrown the ancient
ruins. There is a faint smell of salty sea water coming from the east,
and to the west the path heads back to a T-junction in the swamps.

Wading through the bloody waters of the harbour~
You are standing knee deep in the red tinted waters of the ancient
harbour. Your steps are made harder by the sucking and clinging mud
beneath the murky water, and the air is warm with the smell of blood.
There are no fish to be seen and there is a total lack of animal prescence
where normally water would attract much attention. Something very
disturbing has happened here, and the power of it still lingers in the
region. The harbour heads east and south, or you can go north onto the
ruined docks.

In a burnt out harbour-master's room~
You are in the ruined remains of what was once the harbour master's room
for this port of Myth Drannor's boats. There is nothing here now but the
smell of blood and a feeling of disturbed peace. It is as if time has
stopped here, capturing the feel and blood of the ancient fall of the
city, rather than being just another dried out hole that you would expect.
You can head south onto the docks.

At the edge of the swampland ruins~
You are at the eastern edge of the ruins amongst the overgrown swamps. To
the east you can make out what looks like the ruins of one of the city's
ancient harbours. Unlike the rest of the swampy ruins the harbour to the
east seems to be relatively free of swamp and forest growth, and there is
the strong smell of salt water, or blood, in the air...
