This beautiful creature is the whitest of whites, its eyes sparkling like
sapphires, its spiral horn and cloven hooves of a shiny silver. Graceful,
it resembles a horse, but it has the beard of a goat. Tufts of hair on its
long tail remind you of another creature, but you can't quite remember the
name of it. It also has wings! Such a beautiful creature...

@rus Лес здесь настолько густой и колючий, что путь на восток становится
непроходимым. С макушек высоких деревьев доносятся птичиье пение.

@eng End of Path in the Dark Wood@rus Конец Тропинки в Дремучем Лесу~
@eng The canopy of leaves above you has just about blocked out all the light. The
path goes no farther north, but continues south. The shrubbery is thick
around you. You hear the faint song of birds to the west.
@rus Лесной полог над тобой полностью закрывает весь свет. Тропинка больше не идет

@eng The foliage is so thick here it's a wonder you can move. Up above, the trees
form a dark canopy keeping most of the light out. You hear the very faint
songs of birds from the west.

over. The foliage here is thick and the trees tall. From above come the songs
of birds. Looking to the south you see that the way is impassable, blocked
by thick shrubs and thorny bushes.

@eng Small Pool in the Glade@rus Маленький Родничок на Поляне~
@eng Surrounded by thick foliage and tall trees, the soft grass in the clearing
is broken only by a small pool of clear, sweet water, gurgling up from
underground, and snaking a small ways until it finds a path back underground.
Looking down at it, the shape is sort of like a ball with a snaky tail. Shiny
white rocks line the perimeter of the pool. The glade continues to the north.
@rus Окруженная пышным кустарником и высокими деревьями, мягкая травка на полянке
соседствует лишь только с маленьким родничком с прозрачной, сладковатой водой,
бьющей из-под земли, которая чуть струится, чтобы опять вернуться под землю.
Посмотрев на него, создается впечатление клубка расползающихся змей. Светящиеся
белые камни окружают источник. Полянка простирается дальше на север.

are two pine trees that look almost exactly alike, and below them are some
dead needles. The wood to the east becomes thick again almost immediately,
and you feel an imposing evil coming from that direction.

A high but unkempt wall lies to the east. Closer examination of the wall
reveals that what you thought were cracks are actually spider webs on the
surface of the wall. You cannot peer beyond the wall. The very essence of
evil permeates the place.

By the Western Wall~
The well-made wall to the west is too high to peer over. Here the woods are
not too thick but not thin either. The trees are silver-barked with golden
leaves.

By the Natural Spring~
A spring gurgles from the ground here, forming an oval-shaped pool. Someone
has put shiny black stones around the edges of the pool. To the south is a
well-constructed wooden building with a sign on a post near it.

Entrance to the Magic Forest~
The path stretches north and south. To your west is a clearing, and you hear
the sounds of gurgling water coming from there. East of you are pine trees.

The Five Pines~
In the midst of a small clearing are five pine trees, each spaced evenly
apart, forming the points of an equilateral pentagon. You can only guess
that some sentient being placed them here, rather than nature. In the
very center of the 'pentagon' is a very small pine tree, appearing to be
newly planted. To the south is a wall, too high to peer over. From the
east comes the sound of gurgling water.

By the Start of a Small Stream~
A spring gurgles here, forming a small stream that flows south. It seems to
have found a way to pass the wall to the south, for you can hear the sound
of water beyond the wall. All around are pine trees. You may have to move the
needles out of the way before you drink from the clear stream.

By the Southern Wall~
The wall to the south seems to close in on you here. It is too high to peer
over. All around you are pine trees, and the forest floor is covered with
pine needles. A small squirrel regards you warily then scampers off. You
hear the sound of gurgling water from the west.

By the Blackened Pines~
The pine trees here are all blackened, trunks, needles... not so much as
though a fire had harmed them, but as though something unnatural had so
darkened their color as to eliminate anything that appeared life-like. Still,
you can tell that they live, for the low blackened branch of one is pliable.
The needles on the ground are black, as well. An aura of evilness permeates
this place. To the south is a wall, blackened like the trees.

By the Blackened Wall~
The wall to the south has been blackened by something, perhaps fire, perhaps
something else. The trees here are few, and they, too, are blackened, and
yet you can tell that they live. The needles on the forest floor are also
blackened. An aura of evilness permeates this place.

The eastern wall, covered with spider webs, and the southern wall, blackened,
meet at the southeastern corner. The few trees here are blackened like the
wall, like the few trees to the west. Black needles partly cover the forest
floor here, but looking at it you can see some of the soil. It is black, too.

of a 10-point buck and a green dragon. A fireplace graces one wall, and
on the mantle are a quiver of arrows and a stuffed raccoon. You see a
stair leading up.

On a Hillock~
The ground rises a little here, and the most interesting part of this part
of the wood is not that there are ill-appearing trees here, or shrubs in
need of healing, but that there is a structure here, a house, and it stands
on four feet. A ladder leads to the door, and there are windows with frilly
curtains.

The Kitchen~
Amazingly enough, this elevated house is sturdy enough to support a fire pit.
Surrounded by stones, it is filled with something flammable which is
currently burning. Suspended over the fire is a large black pot, partially
covered and simmering, and the aroma is tempting. A counter which appears to
have been used recently to prepare food is against one wall, and a table and
three chairs in the corner.

skills with weapons, and how to dress a killed beast to turn it into food.
