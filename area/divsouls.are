sym jester~
Sym~
A lithe jester frolicks in the shadows.
~
A cartwheeling flurry slows momentarily to resolve itself into a slim,
green-clad figure crowned by a tassled jester's hat.  Stitched in gold
across the right and left breast pockets you notice the words:
"Sym"
and
"To wonder is to grow"
The left pocket is partially tinted with grass stains.

belong to the present.

well cared for, although those shears he's waving around look sort of lethal 
to anything living that might get in the way..

A middle rank assassin, the stalker has trained extensively in the
arts of death.  Increase in status up to this level has been obtained
by consent of the deathmaster, as the assassination of other clan
members while below this rank is cause for immediate death.  Rise in
rank for the stalker from now on will come only through the assassination
of one of higher rank.  Hence, the stalker seeks to hone his abilities
to perfection, for a failed assassination attempt means instant death,
and those above him are anything but strangers to the art.

a Zdreni avenger~
A darkly clad figure watches you, a cruel smile playing across its lips.
~
A slender dark elven form stands before you, eyes glimmering with a
strange, cruel light which seems to glow in the darkness like twin flames.
The avenger is among the best in blade, stealth, and magic of the clan
and is sworn to destroy all who spill the blood of a Zdreni clan member.
Deemed to be beyond the rank structure and fierce competition among
the clan members for status, the avenger is extremely loyal to all members
of the clan.  Shimmering above the collarbone is the form of a stooping
hawk over two crossed daggers.

artwork white object bones thing~
A ghastly array of bones, bent in impossible angles and melded together, form
a huge domelike structure.  The bones are polished to a sick white gleam and 
seem to twist and change even as you look at them.  A large gap is visible in 
the western face of the object, shifting occasionally with the movement of 
the bones.

Water, remarkably clear despite the muddy rivulets which feed it, forms a 
flat circular pool in the center of the cavern.  As you gaze at the pool,
you reflection seems to twist and darken.  Grinning, it beckons, and you feel 
drawn towards the pool.  The pool ripples and clears, and your reflection 
returns to normal.  Or did it ever really change.. ?

  in this web of silver wires
  thinner than thread
  and brighter than steel
  we wander --
  dazzled by myriad glints,
  pulsing with knowledge
  and glowing with power...
  And in that glow,

  we know
  and yet are decieved

  we thrive
  and yet we drown

  we grow
  and we are dwarfed

  we are alone
  and never lonely

  we are lost
  and we are found.

  Reaching into the icy darkness

  a glimmer of laughter
  emerges from the depths of memory
  to brush his heart,
  before flickering away,
  leaving traces
  like threads of gold
  shimmering warmly in the darkness.

  Picking up the threads,
  he weaves them together --
  Together my friends.
  Forever my friends.

  And against the deepening darkness
  Echoing in my ears,
  The golden roar of a lion.

ice mask~
A poem is engraved on the inside of the mask:

  A flurry of icy flakes
  blocking out the searing sun
  and wrapping me
  in their cool, soft embrace

  The cold in my mind
  to freeze the memories
  The ice in my heart
  to chill the pain
  The cool in my eyes
  to freeze the tears
  to ice.
