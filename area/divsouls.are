"To wonder is to grow"
The left pocket is partially tinted with grass stains.

of the influence of his position and his ability to retain it despite
the power games of those below him.  The image of two crossed daggers

the Zdreni stalker~
A silent figure stalks in the shadows.
~
A middle rank assassin, the stalker has trained extensively in the
arts of death.  Increase in status up to this level has been obtained
by consent of the deathmaster, as the assassination of other clan
members while below this rank is cause for immediate death.  Rise in
rank for the stalker from now on will come only through the assassination
of one of higher rank.  Hence, the stalker seeks to hone his abilities
to perfection, for a failed assassination attempt means instant death,
and those above him are anything but strangers to the art.

Deemed to be beyond the rank structure and fierce competition among
the clan members for status, the avenger is extremely loyal to all members
of the clan.  Shimmering above the collarbone is the form of a stooping
hawk over two crossed daggers.
