The blade of the sword is a full meter long, and straight as an arrow, with
lightly fluted sides. Both edges keened down to perfect lines, invisibly
sharp. Perfection like this could of only been forged by a god. The black
hilt is contrasted only by the faint symbol of the Scales of Justice.
Apon the blade is engraved a poem:

                      The Sword of Justice balances the pans
                      Of right and wrong, and foul and fair
                      Eye for an eye, Doomgiver scans
                      The fate of all folk everywhere.

This is one shop to stay away from. Rashan's rutabagas have been know

very very empty. I'm sure Rashan would be more than willing to sell
you one. Business obviously has been very slow....

Lexie's Scuba Shop~
This is one shop that seems to be ahead of its time.
But who doesn't like scuba diving. If you don't already have
a diving license you can buy one. Lexie can also train you too. Not  in
scuba though. Something about a revoked teaching credential due to too
many students dying or something. This does seem to be an odd place to have
a scuba shop considering the sea is miles away. But I guess you could
always go diving in the lake. But why?....

Long Hallway~
This hallway is sparse compared to some of the others. It seems to go
on and on. The marble floors are barren of any type of decorations.
The walls are rough stone bound by large wooden beams. This is maybe
the only hallway that doesn't have large amounts of gold and other artifacts.

North End of Bar~
A smoky fire struggles in the blackened stove, feebly challenging
the gloom in the town. In sharp contrast to the usual lively crowd,
the few patrons present are lost in their own thoughts. No one
smiles, nor does anyone seem interested in the arrival of a few
more customers.
