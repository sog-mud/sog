@eng Entrance to the Shadow Grove@rus Тропа, ведущая в дремучий лес~
@eng Before you, the grove of shadows lies. Giant grey trees are all that
can be seen through the thick shadows. A great sense of both power and
menace permeates the surrounding area. You have a strange urge to turn
back and go back the way you've come.
  A small path leads north into the shadows and back south to the road.
@rus Перед тобой находится дремучий лес. Серые гигантские деревья -- это все, что
можно разглядеть сквозь гущу теней. Ощущение мощи и опасности  пронизывает 
ближайшее пространство. Ты чувствуешь странный порыв развернуться и пойти
назад по дороге, по которой ты сюда $gn{nопал}.
  Узкая тропа ведет вглубь леса на север, на юг простирается широкая дорога.

underfoot, and the signs of fire here and there. It is almost as if the
plant life shuns this spot. The shadowy mist hovers all around, obscuring
your view into the grove.
  A small path leads north to some shadowy structure. All other exits are
shrouded in shadowy mist.
@rus Ты находишься на небольшой полянке посреди леса. Трава под твоими ногами
обуглена и повсюду видны признаки пожара. Кажется даже самые малые ростки
жизни избегают это место. Густой туман нависает в воздухе, мешая тебе
всмотреться в глубь леса.
  Узкая тропа ведет на север, к какому-то сумеречному строению. Все остальные
пути покрыты мраком.

tower looms above you at an incredible height. It seems to disappear
into the storm clouds above.
  A diamond gate is to the north, guarded by a huge golem. The trail
back south has disappeared behind you.
@rus Ты $gn{подошел} ко входу в высокую колдовскую башню. Башня предстала перед тобой

исчезают в грозовых тучах.

inside than it is on the outside. Young mages walk about, completely
oblivious to your presence.
  Exits lead north to the common room, west to the dinning room, east to
a plain hallway and back south through the gate.

переменах между тяжелыми занятиями.  Они беседуют здесь, играют в

Однако, в данный момент комната практически пуста, очевидно, не обеденное

a huge black oven against one wall, it must be at least 12 feet high.
Opposite the oven is an equally enormous meat locker, large enough to
comfortably store several hapless adventurers no doubt. In the middle of
the room, hanging in mid-air is a spice rack.
@rus Ты находишься в маленькой кухоньке. Однако, вся кухонная утварь умещается
здесь, включая далеко не самые простые приборы. Среди них огромная духовка
стоит возле стены, она, должно быть, три с половиной метра в высоту. Напротив
нее такой же громадный холодильник, настолько вместительный, что запросто мог
вместить бы нескольких злополучных искателей приключений.

light filters through from above. A faint sound of dripping water can be

their garbage. Faint gurgling can be heard from beneath the surface of the

  Exits lead back north, or perhaps for the very adventurous, down into the

You are in the scrying chamber of the high tower of sorcerery. It is here
that arcane rituals are performed to enable those of the art to look in
upon denizens throughout the world and spy out their darkest secrets.
  A huge black cauldron is in the center of the room, bubbling and gurgling,
it pours forth a constant stream of smokey fog into the air about you. Here
and there on stands of different sizes are crystal balls and oddly shaped
mirrors.
