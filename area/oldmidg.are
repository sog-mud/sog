look indestructible, yet they are elaborate in engravings. You can hear
laughter and good cheer from the other  side  of these gates. Obviously, the
city is teeming with activity! There is a small gold plaque on mounted on the
archway.
@rus Ты стоишь под сводом гигантской каменной арки. Покрытые сложной искусной
гравировкой стальные ворота выглядят неприступными. С другой стороны ворот до
тебя доносятся смех и приветственные возгласы. В этом городе явно вовсю кипит
жизнь! На арке укреплена небольшая золотая пластинка.

are not the first to wander here. Before you somebody has left footprints.
The footprints make a path that looks rather bewildered and is not the kind
of path to lead to anywhere significant or important but it seems to have
made up its mind to enter the hills far away north.  A little distance
further, you lose the trail and decide not to get lost.

@eng The Magic Shop@rus Магазин магических вещей~
@eng You are in a small room that smells of rare chemicals and spices.
Dividing the room in two is a large desk, and on the wall behind it are
numerous shelves crammed with jars, bottles, books and scrolls of all
sorts and sizes.
@rus Ты находишься в маленькой комнатке, насквозь пропахшей неизвестными химикалиями и специями.
Длинный прилавок делит комнату пополам, и на стене позади него ты видишь пронумерованные полки,
заставленные склянками, бутылками, книжками и свитками всех цветов, сортов и размеров.

The Jeweller's Shop~
You are in a small, beautifully furnished room.  The warm light emanating
from the small oil lamps on the walls is reflected in the hard, polished
surface of the big mahogany desk that stands in the centre of the room.
A small sign with golden letters stands on the desk.

@eng Necromancer's laboratory@rus Некромантская лаборатория~
This is the Magical Experiments Laboratory of Necromancy.  Dark
smoke-stained stones arch over numerous huge oaken tables, most of these
cluttered with strange-looking flasks.  The floor is covered with
half-erased pentagrams and even weirder symbols, and a blackboard in a dark
corner has only been partially cleaned, some painful-looking letters faintly
visible.  A well in the middle of the floor leads down into darkness.  Vile
smells waft from the depths.
