Edge of the Blight~
The air here is much more humid than in the borderland kingdom of Shienar
to the south.  Each breath is a labor, taxing your strength as you move
through the area.  Trees still grow here, corrupted and twisted by the
Shadow that lays heavily across this cursed land.  Decay and disease
surrounds you on all sides as you realize youa re far from the Light.  To
the north you can see what remains Malkeri, swallowed by The Blight, its
Seven Towers broken by the hands of The Dark One.

Entering the Blight~
The corrupted tress of the Blight sway in the wind, leaves and branches
seeming to grab at you as you pass by them.  Your nightmares seem like
fanciful daydreams compared to the evil that has seized this land.  Only
fools and highly-trained Warders enter this far into the Blight, and even
the deadly skills of the Warders are sometimes not enough to keep them
alive.  A little further to the north lie the Towers of Malkeri, surrounded
by almost a hundred small lakes.

Near the Seven Towers~
You stand only a few miles from the Seven Towers of the once great
Malkeri.  Lakes surround the entire area, their waters dark and cloudy, so
dark they seem to swallow the light around them, seeming to reel and bubble
moving the shadowy water to small waves.  This far into the Blight live
creatures that could easily kill a dozen heavily armed Bordermen, creatures
created by the Dark One to watch over his land.

Among the Seven Towers~
You now ride along the bases of the Seven Towers, once the kingdom of
Malkeri held back the tides of Shadowspan relentlessly seeking to crush the
lands to the south.  It's power now broken the Towers are in ruins, lying on
top of the foothills leading to the Mountains of Dhoom, all but two are utterly
destroyed, the two standing towers are to the east and west.  The taint of the
Shadow is much heavier now, you feel the evil now living in Malkeri. All the
trees and plants in this area are only barely holding on, decay taking them as
quickly as they grow.  Waves roll along the Hundred Lakes, and hope is far
away.

The Blight~

The air here is much more humid than in the borderland kingdom of Shienar

heavily across this cursed land.  Decay and disease surrounds you on all sides

The sound of a thousand wings fill your ears as your realize in horror that the

you to rend your flesh and spirit.

area.  Trees still grow here, corrupted amd twisted bt the Shadow that lays
heavily across this land.  Decay and disease surround you on all sides as you
realize you are far from the Light.

You have stumbled across a scouting party of Trollocs.  A small fire burns
in the center of the camp.  They appear to be preparing to enjoy a Trolloc
delicacy, you stomach wrenches as you realize what they are devouring.  They

Although you can tell this was a stables at one time from the stalls and

but of death, and dust.  No one has used this room as a stables for a very long
time, all the stalls are empty, and whatever grain may have been stored here as
feed has long since rotted away.  The only exit from this room is to the south,

of humans and Trollocs alike litter the floor.  You notice with respect that
the Malkeri must have killed three Trollocs for every man that died after a
quick survey of the skeletons.

crushed them in the room to the north.  You eye what was once an stout wooden
door, reinforced with iron bars, smashed now into kindling.  To the east and
west are two small doors, probably guard rooms, while to the south you see a
massive iron portcullis, still intact, and rusted completely shut, it's opening
mechanism either destroyed by the defenders of the tower, or possibly it's

one of the Hundred Lakes.  The water in the tank is no fouled like the water in
the lakes themselves.  A door leads back into the hallway to  the south, while

Long ago, the finest warriors in the borderlands practiced thier skills in
this room, shattered remnants of weapons, and a few skeletons are all that
remains.  Through the blood and wreckage of this room, a slogan is painted all

dead warriors.  One that never came to be...

Trolloc hordes that fell this mighty tower were very thorough in thier
destruction.  All that is left is twisted metal and splintered wood among the

The Hallway~
You are now in a hallway in the basement of the tower.  Faded banners and
black streaks of dried blood line the walls.  A set of stairs can be seen off
to the south leading down into the tower.  A small door is set in the northern
wall, and, the hallway continues to the east.

symbols written in the blood of the dead.

The Training Room~
Long ago, the finest warriors in the borderlands practiced thier skills in
this room, shattered remnants of weapons, and a few skeletons are all that
remains.  Through the blood and wreckage of this room, a slogan is painted all
across the northern wall, 'May peace favor your sword.'  A dream for these long
dead warriors.  One that never came to be...

Yoou have come across the towers armoury.  If you could repair what is left
in this shattered room, you could equip a small army.  Unfourtunately, the
Trolloc hordes that fell this mighty tower were very thorough in thier
destruction.  All that is left is twisted metal and splintered wood among the
rotting leather.

this area was surely checked, that none of the cells stand open.  Two of the
cells hold skeletons hanging from rotting ropes appearantly made from rotting
bedding.  Surely the Shadowspawn that took the tower would have freed thier

Foxes and Snakes~
Your mind is still foggy, but a memory of a childhood game struggles to the

hunting snipes, as you survey the scene you realize why.  You are suspeneded in
mid-air by some unseen force, all around you pale humanoids observe you
grinning with canine maws.  They are too tall to be humans, and too thin.  You
are glad that whatever force keeps you from moving on stops them from getting

you are unable to enter further into the room.  You have never seen the man
before, but you sense he is a man great power.  The kind who contols other men
and women fates with uncommon ease, sitting before a glowing screen, working

at a table on the far side of the room.  They do not notice you, and you cannot
seem to get thier attention.  More importantly, as you look at some of the
windows in the room, you see great battles taking place, people you know
talking back in the town you come from, people living and dying, being reborn,
and dying again.  And the men in the room don't even notice!  You feel a great

Traditionally the Malkerians defended this gap.  Once that that kingdom fell
the duty fell to the borderland kingdom of Shienar.  You see more than a fist
of Trollocs camped in the gap.  Going further to the north would be suicide.
With the Dragonwall to the east, and the Mountains of Dhoom to the north, you

Near the Mountains of Dhoom~
You stand at the base of the Mountains of Dhoom.  If things are this bad
hundreds of miles from Shayol Ghul, you shiver at what the Blasted Lands to the
north of the range must be like, fully in the embrace of Ba'alzamon.  You are
not to disappointed to find no pass north into the range.

The Moutains and the Sea~
A grotesque and disturbing site meets you eyes here.  The Blight continues
on to the south and east with all of it's death and decay strong in your mind.
To the north lay the Mountains of Dhoom, that few men have travelled north of,
and even less have returned.  But, what lies to the west is perhaps the most
disturbing of all.  You are standing on the shore of the Dead Sea.  It's black
and lifeless waters are perfectly still like a huge mirror of pollished
obsidian.  It's calm and lack of life chill you to the bone, surely one step
into those evil waters would mean your death.
