Entrance Hall~
You are in a cramped, low ceiling tunnel. Roots dangle overhead and caress 
you. There are tiny doors to the north, south and west, which you think you 
could crawl your way into. A ladder fashioned of woven roots leads up. You 
hear sounds of a raucous celebration to the east.

and a great pile of junk beneath the sign.
