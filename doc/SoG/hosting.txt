Common server setup
===================

1) Create user:group `sog:sog' with '*' (for FreeBSD) or 'x' (for Linux)
as password (to prevent logging in).

If you need quotas, group sog must have ~300M quota.

`sog' home should not have rwx permissions for `other'.

2) Create users that have direct access to mud server:

	login	| full name		| shell
	--------+-----------------------+--------------
	fjoe	| Max Khon		| tcsh (or bash)
	tatyana	| Tatyana Novikova	| bash
	mmm	| Marat M. Mirzaev	| bash
	avn	| Alexey Neyman		| bash
	cs	| Constantin Svintsoff	| bash
	matrim	| Sergey A. Menzhulin	| bash
	murazor	| Dmitriy Shichkov	| bash

All these users should be in group `sog'.

If system policy is to NOT create per-user groups you can set primary
group to `sog' for all these users instead of default `users' or whatever
is used on your system.

CVS server setup
================

1) See 'Common server setup'

2) Unpack SoG CVS root somewhere, preferred location is /usr/local/cvsroot.
If you unpacked it to some other place please make symbolic link
from /usr/local/cvsroot to the location where you placed CVS root.

CVS root should be owned by sog:sog with group write permissions on
directories (files in CVS root do not have 'w' bit set at all and this is ok).

CVS root should not have rwx permissions for `other'.

If you are using Linux also set group suid bit on directories (FreeBSD
inherits group ownership for newly created files from directory they
are created in by default).

3) Checkout CVSROOT ('cvs -d <cvsroot> co CVSROOT'),
build mailsend.c ('gcc -o mailsend mailsend.c') and install it into
/usr/local/bin ('install -u root -g wheel -c mailsend /usr/local/bin'
for FreeBSD, 'install -u root -g root -c mailsend /usr/local/bin').

Mud server setup
================

1) See 'Common server setup'

2) Add an ability to switch to user `sog' for all users in group `sog' (sudo)

Sample `%ETCDIR%/sudoers' file:

--- cut here ---
# User alias specification
User_Alias SOG=%sog

# Cmnd alias specification
Cmnd_Alias SUSOG=/bin/su - sog,/bin/su sog

# User privilege specification
SOG	ALL=NOPASSWD:SUSOG
--- cut here ---

3) Create scripts to start mud server on system startup.

If you are using FreeBSD simply copy sog/bin/rc.sog.sh to
/usr/local/etc/rc.d/sog.sh and edit `sog_home' variable in it.

4) All files in `sog' home should be owned by `sog:sog' with group
write permissions.

If you are using Linux also set group suid bit on directories (FreeBSD
inherits group ownership for newly created files from directory they
are created in by default).

Developer environment setup
===========================

The following steps (except step 4) should be executed on your
development host.

1) Create an alias for sog cvs server in your ~/.ssh/config.

Sample entry:

--- cut here ---
Host cvs-sog
	Hostname sog.me.ru
--- cut here ---

2) Set CVS_RSH environment variable to ssh (add 'setenv CVS_RSH ssh'
to your ~/.cshrc if you are using tcsh or 'export CVS_RSH=ssh'
tou ~/.bashrc if you are using bash). This step is not required if
you are using FreeBSD 4.x and later because FreeBSD cvs uses ssh by default.

3) Create ~/.cvsrc:

Sample .cvsrc:
--- cut here ---
cvs -q
co -P
diff -u --show-c-function
update -Pd
--- cut here ---

4) Make sure that on CVS _SERVER_ host you have umask set to 002
(command `umask' should say `002', if it says something else
add 'umask 002' to your ~/.cshrc if you are using tcsh or
to ~/.bashrc if you are using bash.

After all this steps you can checkout SoG 2 sources by issuing command

cvs -d :ext:cvs-sog:/usr/local/cvsroot co sog

If you need to checkout SoG 1 sources use the following command:

cvs -d :ext:cvs-sog:/usr/local/cvsroot co -r SOG_1_0 -d sog1 sog
