2) following all guidelines in the ROM license (contained in the file

   The help files must include a ANATOLIA entry, readable by all players,
   and unaltered from the file included with the source code, except as
   authorized by the ANATOLIA authors.
4) Before opening a ANATOLIA based mud, you must send email to the author
   (bulut@rorqual.cc.metu.edu.tr and canpunar@anatolia.cc.metu.edu.tr), so
   that I can keep track of sites for future code releases.
5) Any use of the term Realms of Anatolia or Anatolia MUD remains the
   exclusive copyright of Serdar BULUT and Ibrahim CANPUNAR, this includes
   the sole right to release future versions of ANATOLIA source code, and

   Permission to use the name Realms of Anatolia and Anatolia MUD has been
   granted to Silverleaf (Donovan K Cozzens <donocoz@juno.com), his mud
   will remain the only one with that privilige, unless otherwise is
   declared by Serdar BULUT and Ibrahim CANPUNAR.
6) As a coder, you have full rights to release your own derivatives of the
   ANATOLIA code, provided they follow the restrictions of this license, 
   contain all appropriate README and credits files, and are properly
   labelled as being derivatives of the ANATOLIA 2.1 code (just as ANATOLIA
   is itself a derivative of Gamma 0.0, Merc 2.1 and ROM 2.4 code).  
7) Anyone not wishing to follow terms of the ANATOLIA license shall be 
   obligated to delete all copies of this code in their possession.  This
