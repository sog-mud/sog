Some notes on modules implementation:
-------------------------------------

- every module should reside in mod_xxx directory
- module's Makefile should define `MODULE' variable
  (it should hold module name) 
- module's exported dynafun's should be declared in the .h file
  which should have the same name as module itself (the file
  should be placed to common include directory)

Module dependencies generator depends on the stuff mentioned above.

E.g: module `foo' should reside in directory mod_foo,
its exported dynafuns should be defined in file `foo.h'
and its Makefile should look like this:

--- cut here ---
#
# $Id
#

MODULE=		foo
CFILES=		foo.c bar.c

.include <bsd.prog.mk>
--- cut here ---

Although dynafun_call/dynaproc_call functions do their best at
checking arg types dynafuns (and dynaprocs) should ALWAYS check
all their args and should NEVER make any expectations about them
(e.g. they should not rely on/expect that some parameter `ch' will
always be IS_NPC).

Callers of dynafuns should ALWAYS expect (check) that return value
can be 0 (NULL).
