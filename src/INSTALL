To build SoG you must take the following steps:

1) cp Makefile.osdep.dist Makefile.osdep
2) uncomment options for your system in Makefile.osdep
3) make depend
4) make all
5) make install

You need pmake to build SoG under Linux
`mkdep' can be found in mkdep/ (it is needed to run `make depend') --
just copy it into any directory in your $PATH.

To run mud server
 - use ../bin/sog.sh for production use
   if you are running mud under FreeBSD you can put ../bin/rc.sog.sh
   to /usr/local/etc/rc.d/sog.sh to start mud automagically when booting the
   system
 - use ./startup for debugging
