To build SoG you must take the following steps:

1) cp Makefile.osdep.dist Makefile.osdep
2) uncomment options for your system in Makefile.osdep
3) make depend
4) make all
5) make install

You need pmake to build SoG under Linux (you may need to invoke it with
`pmake -m mk')
`mkdep' can be found in mkdep/ (it is needed to run `make depend') --
just copy it into any directory in your $PATH.

To run mud server
 - use ../bin/sog.sh for production use
   if you are running mud under FreeBSD you can put ../bin/rc.sog.sh
   to /usr/local/etc/rc.d/sog.sh to start mud automagically when booting the
   system
 - use ./startup for debugging

NOTE: if you are using FreeBSD 3.x/4.x do not forget to put bin/rndcontrol.sh
to /usr/local/etc/rc.d so that /dev/urandom will get enough randomness.
Do not forget to change irq numbers to match your system. Good randomness
sources are network card, keyboard and mouse irqs
