To build SoG you must take the following steps:

1) cp Makefile.inc.dist Makefile.inc
2) edit Makefile.inc (at least uncomment options for your system)
3) make depend
4) make all
5) make install

You need pmake to build SoG under Linux
`mkdep' can be found in mkdep/ (it is needed to run `make depend') --
just copy it into any directory in you $PATH.
